00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,799
Hello folks. How are you? Hope you're

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,960
doing well. Welcome back. This is

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,960
October 11th, 2025

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,080
and we're going to be focusing on Forex

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,800
here for a moment with the usual

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,720
suspects, dollar index, Euro dollar and

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,039
pound dollar.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,640
All righty. On the left hand side, per

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,280
usual, the daily chart, and on the right

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,320
hand side, the five-minute chart. So,

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,160
you can see the dollar index. Um, last

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,320
time we talked, we were down in here,

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,079
and I said I wanted to see it, you know,

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,079
kind of give me a little bit more

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,079
inspiration behind it. I told you I was

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,000
expecting dollar index to go higher. I

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
was bullish on dollar. You can check

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
that, go back and look at the

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,680
recordings. It's not ambiguous. It's

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,760
rather one-sided.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
uh framed off of this inversion fair

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,079
value gap. Then the bullish fair value

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,000
gap in here and then using the

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,840
consequent encouragement and quadrants

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
of the wick in here. And then we have

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,960
this inversion fair value gap with the

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,720
volume imbalance

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,640
the market started to rally up. Took out

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
the buy side in here and worked inside

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,439
of this sell side of balance buy side

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,920
efficiency which is graded. You can see

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
that the upper quadrant was pierced by

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
the bodies and then on Friday we had a

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,439
little bit of retracement back down into

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
a volume imbalance. Here we have a

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
suspension block which is a candlestick

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,439
that has a volume imbalance to the high

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,200
end of it and a volume imbalance to the

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,159
low end of it. It need not okay for the

40
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,960
guys out there trying to teach.

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,079
You don't even know what you're doing

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,560
yet. But I understand you got to get

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,479
your ad revenue and sell your courses.

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,000
But the uh the candlestick need not be a

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
inefficiency.

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,360
In other words, it need not have any one

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,119
single pass with the candlestick.

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,640
So it could have a candlestick to the

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,439
left of it that was a fullbodied candle

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,360
or a wick that completely overlaps the

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
entire range between the upper and lower

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
volume of balance. Okay? So that that's

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
the distinguishing characteristic. This

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
is why this PDA is a little bit

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,239
different than you probably thought it

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
was the first time I mentioned it. But

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
anyway, we have a suspension block here.

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
Uh the market trades from this open here

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
down into

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,800
midpoint of this range that's shaded in

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
blue. And we trade right back down into

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,440
that on Friday.

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,840
Having all this information in this

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,519
vicinity on the daily chart transposed

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,120
over to the 5-minute chart. You can see

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
they're on the New York open kill zone,

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,080
which is 7:00 a.m. 10:00 a.m. Eastern

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,720
time, always New York local time. Uh the

69
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,879
market trades above the upper quadrant.

70
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,920
That's this 99.368

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
level. You can check that there. We

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
pierce it. We break lower and shift in

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
market structure there and a retracement

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
up. So you can see the 79% 62%

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
retracement respectively. That's optimal

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
trade entry. Uh very minimum it's got to

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
go above

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,920
the low to high.

79
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,800
It's got to go to 50% or higher for it

80
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,959
to be in a premium market. And that's

81
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,920
the ICT model 2022. Okay. So, for the

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
folks who say it doesn't work anymore,

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
it's there every day. So, the market

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
trades up into optimal trading trade.

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,760
So, if you was just a standard flagship

86
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
pattern trader that my channel was

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,319
really based on in the beginning back in

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,560
2012,

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,840
uh that uh that pattern is here in and

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,920
of itself. We have an inversion fair

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,040
value gap which is this buy side of

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,080
balance sell efficiency. We we break

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
below it leave it here and then come

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
back in. As you see the bodies are

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,519
finding resistance.

96
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay. So there's premium sensitivity

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,599
here at the consequent encroachment of

98
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,680
that inversion fair value gap and the

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
market gives up the ghost and breaks

100
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,319
aggressively lower trading through the

101
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,920
midpoint or consequent encroachment of

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,799
this inefficiency

103
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,199
here. And it's this range from the low

104
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,720
of this closing candle price volume

105
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
bounce included up to this candlesticks

106
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,199
low. Now I have it shaded in pink

107
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
because it acts as a premium array to

108
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,120
draw up into. Okay. So I'm not I'm not

109
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
classifying it technically as an

110
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
inversion fair value gap. That's why

111
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
it's not orange like this here. Okay.

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
Okay, so don't be confused by that. The

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
orientation is when price was down here,

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
I was expecting price to drop into it.

115
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,919
And if you watch the older recordings,

116
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,919
you'll see I mentioned over here and

117
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,680
above all these buy side eventually once

118
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
we get higher that it would consider

119
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,120
that area and it it did. So it's not

120
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,560
just hindsight, but we use that area up

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
here as a premium rate to retrace back

122
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,800
down into a discount array, which is

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
this suspension block. Okay. So, you can

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
see that that volume of bounce right

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
here, these two black line segments,

126
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,440
that's these two segments right here.

127
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,479
And then the market falls out of bed, we

128
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
have a breakaway gap. Uh here is for

129
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,240
your notes. Okay? And I'll talk more

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
about this in the books. Uh the

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,479
breakaway gaps when you classify a

132
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,600
breakaway gap, this is what your

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,919
textbooks do not teach you. every

134
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,240
classic archaic view of retail logic and

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
trading technical analysis which is

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,800
flawed by all measure. Uh the

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
inefficiency that shows up on your chart

138
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,479
that does not get filled back in.

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,720
If it's between a quadrant level like

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,160
this and another quadrant, expect that

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
when we are, you looking for lower

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,479
prices, when it breaks lower, if it

143
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,039
leaves a quadrant like that and breaks a

144
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
little bit lower, this is many time many

145
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,880
times going to act as a breakaway gap

146
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,560
because it's in no man's land between a

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,120
quadrant and another quadrant inside the

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
narrative and bias that the market's

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
moving one direction. And that's how you

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
see a properly classified ICT breakaway

151
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,240
gap.

152
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
You'll never see that illustrated or

153
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
talked about anywhere when it comes to

154
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
gaps. Okay? But that's how you classify

155
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,280
a breakaway gap. Okay? The same

156
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
thing can be said for measuring gaps. So

157
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
a halfway point when there's a gap that

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
is during a move if it's between a

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
quadrant of either an inefficiency,

160
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,720
okay, or an actual gap by a wick. Okay?

161
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
So no matter how you slice it, if you're

162
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
grading your price PDAs as I teach,

163
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,639
whether it be a candlestick wick or a

164
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,319
inefficiency in price action where it's

165
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,639
a body that's being measured, not the

166
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,400
wick, either way, if you're grading that

167
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,960
price level or those price levels and

168
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
you see a gap that appears between two

169
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,919
quadrants, then it's chances are it's

170
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,199
going to be a breakaway gap or a

171
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,160
measuring gap. Okay?

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
throw that in at no extra charge. You'll

173
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
see it in everybody else's courses now.

174
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
But the market breaks lower, trades down

175
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
into that

176
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
suspension block high here, which is the

177
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,000
high of this volume of balance.

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,560
Hits it there perfectly, rallies back

179
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,479
up, finds the low here of that

180
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
old inefficiency here, which is a buy

181
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
side of balance, sell sign efficiency

182
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,919
with the volume imbalance at the

183
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,520
discount level, low end of it.

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,199
So that price is at 98.898

185
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,960
and it hits it perfectly to the tick

186
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
there. That's probably random.

187
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
Working off of a volume of balance also

188
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,479
that's not noted. Rallies up this

189
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,639
portion of this cibby. We can grade that

190
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,360
because it's anchored right on top of a

191
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,840
lower quadrant level. Meaning the 75

192
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,080
level or lower quadrant at 99.054

193
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
054.

194
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
That's this level here, which is one

195
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,240
quarter from the low of this Pon B cell

196
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,919
deficiency

197
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,760
because the gap is laying over top of

198
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,800
key key point here below inside the

199
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,399
narrative that the market should deliver

200
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,320
lower and it's below this inefficiency

201
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,839
which we should expect that to be a

202
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,920
breakaway gap. When another series of

203
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,600
cibies form, this one we look at it as

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
staying open or we want to see it remain

205
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
unfilled. Can it come up and trade into

206
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,519
it a little bit? Sure. But we expect

207
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,360
some measure from its halfway point to

208
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,600
the high of it. That portion should

209
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,080
likely stay open unfilled here. The this

210
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
cibby from this candlestick's low and

211
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
this candlestick's high. That's denoted

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
with these red trend line segments. We

213
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
can grade that and the bodies are

214
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
stopping right at the midpoint, which is

215
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,640
exactly what you want to see when the

216
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
market's bearish.

217
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,399
It's showing you premium sensitivity.

218
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,440
It's not support and resistance. It's

219
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,680
reacting to half of this inefficiencies

220
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,519
range. Even though there's a little wick

221
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,040
there, the wick didn't even touch the

222
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
upper quadrant. The bodies are staying

223
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
at the halfway point indicating what as

224
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
I taught in mentorship. This is

225
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,279
heaviness algorithmically. It's

226
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,279
indicating tipping its hand to you the

227
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
market will want to seek a deeper

228
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,839
discount. What would that be? Below that

229
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,320
low and it trades down to the lower

230
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,399
quadrant. I'm sorry, lower level of this

231
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,160
volume imbalance

232
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,839
which is candlesticks close on this

233
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,800
right here. Okay. And we have a volume

234
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,640
of balance there. trades up into before

235
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
it gives up the ghost inversion fair

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,800
value gap

237
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,959
right here as well. Trading at its

238
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,680
consequent encroachment halfway point

239
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
breaks comes right back up into a volume

240
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
of balance trades lower

241
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
quadrant perfect delivery and trades

242
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,240
down to volume balance on the daily

243
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
chart right there. So all in all just a

244
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,279
really good technical uh Friday.

245
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,519
Moving on to Euro Dollar, uh just pretty

246
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,360
much the opposite. We can see their

247
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,959
sellside liquidity here. They tapped

248
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,200
into that during New York opening kill

249
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
zone 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock in the

250
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
morning Eastern time. Always New York

251
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,760
local time. We have the ICT model 2022

252
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,440
low high 62 to 79% retracement level.

253
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
You can find that on your own charts

254
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
here. But we have a inversion fair

255
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
value. This CBI changes its

256
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,640
characteristic when we trade above it.

257
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,959
We come back down in the wicks are

258
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,360
digging down but we don't get to the low

259
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,440
here. The bodies are staying close to

260
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,079
what consequent encouragement. It

261
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,640
rallies up uses as the discount

262
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,680
sensitivity and then rallies away. All

263
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,480
these wicks converging around this level

264
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,200
here at 1.1574.

265
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,040
That's this old candlesticks low which

266
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
is being graded. Okay. Why am I picking

267
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,120
this one? Because it's lower than this

268
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
one and it's lower than that one. So,

269
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
it's the longest lowest reaching when

270
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
price was dropping down. And below that,

271
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
we have this spots on a bounce also on

272
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,120
efficiency and we trade into that right

273
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
here. Okay, which is not being shown in

274
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,279
the chart because it's during Thursday's

275
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
trading. Friday's trading had a higher

276
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,399
low. That low being at the upper

277
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,320
quadrant of this wick. Why am I using

278
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,839
this wick? Because it's lower than this

279
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,440
wick and it's lower than that wick. and

280
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,200
this wick is lower than that one. So,

281
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,240
it's not a just ambiguous changing rule

282
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,399
based idea where it's just willy-nilly

283
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,240
cherry-picking. It's not cherry-picking.

284
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,959
It's very specific rules in all this

285
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,440
price action in here. Where's the lowest

286
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
reaching wick? This one.

287
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Look at

288
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,639
all of them. This one here, this one's

289
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,920
being graded because it's lower than

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,200
this one is lower than this one. And it

291
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
dug into this inefficiency that's shaded

292
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
in blue. So if it's going to trade down

293
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,600
lower, we have to consider this wick

294
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,279
before we even consider this low being

295
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,560
taken out and trading to consequent

296
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,639
corrosion of this pos balance sell sign

297
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,959
efficiency. And yes, that's why this is

298
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,880
titled ICT advanced liquidity concepts.

299
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,560
It's not baby pips. It's not elementary

300
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,680
school. It's not classic

301
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
you nonsense

302
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
technical analysis concepts that archaic

303
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,320
and nobody and nobody should have any

304
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
faith in any of that stuff. Okay, this

305
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
is technical sciences. It's it's a

306
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,200
different degree of precision.

307
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
So Friday we can see we're using this

308
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
discount wick and the levels there you

309
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,519
can see them being used over here. So

310
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,800
the low of that wick there right on here

311
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,560
it launches from there trades above the

312
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
quadrant lower quadrant and then tears

313
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
off. So this portion down here

314
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
that would be what?

315
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
That would be a breakaway gap. This

316
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
would be a standard B cell deficiency or

317
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,760
busy. You can grade this one and you can

318
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,240
get down here to the lower quadrant. The

319
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,560
body's respecting that as well. We trade

320
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,880
up into the upper quadrant at 1.16220

321
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,600
of this discount wick. Because why am I

322
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
looking at that? Because it was a

323
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
discount array when we were trading

324
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,480
lower and now when we were below it,

325
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,839
it's going to act as what? It's going to

326
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
change its characteristic to a premium

327
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
array. So if you're going to grade it

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
like a gap, you have to have these

329
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,360
levels in mind and it trades up into

330
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
that as well. You might want to take on

331
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,519
your own study. I didn't do it here for

332
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,000
you, but you want to take this high down

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,320
to that low and duplicate that range and

334
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,760
project it up and you'll get pretty much

335
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,480
this area in here. Okay. So, I'll uh

336
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
Larry Williams target shooter ideas from

337
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,320
his old classic 4H 4VHs tape

338
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
futures millionaires confidential

339
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
trading course I think is what it was. I

340
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,120
always butcher the name of it up. It's

341
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,360
old age folks. But uh anyway the buy

342
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,800
side balance sell side efficiency here

343
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,360
almost complete closure we have a

344
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,519
inversion fair that's not noted and it's

345
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,600
traded down to its low here rallies up

346
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,199
then the consequent encroachment

347
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,720
accumulates once more and then starts to

348
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
send a little bit higher we have a minor

349
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,160
buyside liquidity there so we'll see

350
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,240
what we get on uh Sunday's trading so if

351
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,079
you can get any moving higher

352
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,720
right moving on to pound dollar uh we

353
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,199
talked about this gap here and I talked

354
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,120
about the quadrants on these wicks. So

355
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,639
you can see what happens after that.

356
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
Right down she went tearing into this

357
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
candlesticks

358
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,920
premium wick upper quadrant consequent

359
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,160
encroachment in red. So this wick is the

360
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,760
lower of this one inside of this portion

361
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
of price action. So this low this area

362
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
in here that's the lowest one. Lowest

363
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,600
reaching wick is this one here. So

364
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,519
you're going to grade that one and we

365
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,040
cut through candles because we are not

366
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,519
flawed logic of supply and demand. Okay?

367
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,240
So we're going to ignore this range here

368
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
because the algorithm is going to see

369
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,279
past us this and go right back to this

370
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,839
inefficiency. Why? Because this level of

371
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,040
wicking is treated like a gap and a gap

372
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
is reused even after the gap has been

373
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
filled and it would be considered filled

374
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
with this drop down. It went below that

375
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,199
low. But the algorithm is not going to

376
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,560
just toss the baby out with a bath

377
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
water. It's going to refer back to that

378
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
reference point. So, we cut through

379
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,920
looking through time here. And the

380
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,600
question is coming up a lot in my

381
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,880
comment section of my videos and

382
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,639
sometimes you may see it on the X posts

383
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
I put on.

384
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,440
How long do I keep PDAs graded on my

385
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,959
charts? Well, if you remember how I

386
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,959
first started teaching in 2016, the paid

387
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,600
mentorship portion of lectures, I taught

388
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
the IPA data ranges 20, 40, and 60. So,

389
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
you can go back as far as 60 days. And

390
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,160
they're just as, you know, salient 60

391
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,120
days ago than they are just yesterday.

392
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,440
And that in itself proves algorithmic

393
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
sensitivity that there is a reference to

394
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
time referring back to old very specific

395
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,839
levels where now contrast that with

396
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,839
classic support and resistance.

397
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,279
You don't know what high or low the

398
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,480
market's going to use. You don't know

399
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,079
that. I do. And I repeatedly show it

400
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,880
over and over again. And the point is,

401
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,639
it's something that you can learn. Don't

402
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,120
resist it. Don't fight against it. Just

403
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,480
be thankful that it's being made

404
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
available to you and you can study it

405
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,039
for free. And the more time you put into

406
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,720
studying it and documenting your

407
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,799
observations,

408
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,600
tape reading, back testing, logging old

409
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,439
price moves, and marking them up like

410
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
this. By repetition, you'll start seeing

411
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,039
these same signatures over and over and

412
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,120
over again. In the beginning, when I

413
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,880
first started creating this language, I

414
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
had to do these types of things to

415
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
create the very language that you're

416
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
learning. So,

417
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,840
we have a high, low, higher, high.

418
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
Everybody knows that that is my bearish

419
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,039
breaker. But what happens when the

420
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
market is bullish and it trades above

421
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,440
it? It's going to treat it as an

422
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
inversion breaker. Every PDA has an

423
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,880
inversion aspect. It's not inverted,

424
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,440
okay? It's inversion.

425
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
So we use the consequent encouragement

426
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
or mean threshold rather of that

427
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,039
last down candle which is the bearish

428
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,720
breaker. But now it's going to act as

429
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,360
what? A bullish PDA. So you can see the

430
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,799
body stopping dead on the

431
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,039
midpoint

432
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,720
mean threshold there. And then we had

433
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,080
the opening right at that same price. It

434
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,919
rallies up. The next candlestick we drop

435
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
down to it once more. See there's

436
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,320
discount sensitivity there. Rallies and

437
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,840
then the candlestick opens right at the

438
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,080
high of that candlesticks high and then

439
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
digs into a little bit and then rallies

440
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
aggressively creating what? A breakaway

441
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,960
gap

442
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
clearing this high. Now when you see

443
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,039
these types of things you'll see Yahoo

444
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
say, "Well, this is the fairway gap that

445
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm really interested in." Let me tell

446
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,600
you something. If these form

447
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,240
after you have a a breakout of price

448
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,120
action during a consolidation, I never

449
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,919
want to see these traded back into if it

450
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,120
has the willingness to come back down

451
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,160
into that and fill that in.

452
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,039
That's not strength to me.

453
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,679
Order flow, real order flow, algorithmic

454
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,280
order flow is when there's an

455
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,160
inefficiency after discovery, which is

456
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,400
leaving this range here, taking this

457
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,039
high out. When we do this, we want to

458
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,400
see price keep that open. If this stays

459
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,880
open, as long as this remains open, we

460
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,559
have a bullish order flow. We do not

461
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,720
anticipate market coming back down and

462
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,080
closing and then then going higher

463
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,520
because if it goes down and closes that

464
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,679
in, I am not all that bullish. Then can

465
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,640
it do it? Yes, it can. But it's more

466
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,120
problematic if it does for continued

467
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,679
price action higher. You want to see the

468
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,080
indication that yes, there was an

469
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,880
explosive price action move higher. It

470
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,360
created an inefficiency, but the market

471
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,400
is so overzealous to move higher. It

472
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
need not even concern itself with coming

473
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,080
back down in here offering a discount to

474
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
people that would see what classic

475
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
support, resistance, break, and retest.

476
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,280
That's the trash perspective. That's

477
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,240
garbage. Okay? If you're if you're stuck

478
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
looking at the market like that, you're

479
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,320
going to never really understand why

480
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,679
these markets book higher and lower.

481
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,960
You're you're never going to understand

482
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,280
it because you're looking at convoluted

483
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
nonsense to justify an ends to a mean

484
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,080
that that doesn't have any connection.

485
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,799
There's no there's no affinity for these

486
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,559
things algorithmically. It's not there.

487
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,360
But when you start studying price in the

488
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
lens in the language I'm share sharing

489
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,280
with you, you'll get more clarity and

490
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,120
you don't have to like me. You don't

491
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,400
have to, you know, you don't have to

492
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,440
champion my name. It's not what this is

493
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
about. This is about you learning how to

494
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
do this so that way you can eat better

495
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
and take care of your family better.

496
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,720
Okay? I could care less if you like me.

497
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,280
But this is a breakaway gap because it's

498
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
taking out this high and then we are

499
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,120
entering discovery. That means it's

500
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,080
going to discover how much it can move

501
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
and still allow traders to keep buying

502
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,440
it. That's not buying pressure. It just

503
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,799
keeps offering higher, higher, higher,

504
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
higher, higher, higher, higher. It need

505
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,320
not be a lot of contracts or

506
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,320
lots in deference to the forex market of

507
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,799
or shares. If it's a stock, it need not

508
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,320
be a whole lot. It only needs one unit,

509
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,159
one transaction

510
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,120
to print that price.

511
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,000
And all of this price run in here is

512
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
used to then weigh on the sentiment of

513
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,320
market participants because at at this

514
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,600
point down here they may have seen this

515
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
as a bare flag got real heavy and

516
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,720
thinking wow it's really going to go

517
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,280
lower then it starts to consolidate and

518
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
then we start to move higher and they

519
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,240
don't know what to do with it and then

520
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,440
when these highs get taken out here then

521
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,120
all the Johnny come lately pile in

522
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,799
saying well we always knew it was going

523
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,960
to go higher and we're going to buy out

524
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
on a breakout and they're thinking, you

525
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,240
know, they're they're buying strength,

526
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
but they're chasing where's their stop

527
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
loss going to be in all that price run.

528
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,760
It's too big, too high. Okay, so the

529
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,440
market trades up into the

530
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
consequent encroachment level here of

531
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,039
this wick, discount wick at 1.33637.

532
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,039
And you can see that level here. And you

533
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,360
can do a measured move type thing here.

534
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
The same range from this high down to

535
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,039
that low. Duplicate that and send it up

536
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,720
here. And you'll pretty much get the the

537
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,559
bulk of where the bodies are are

538
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,280
converging right there.

539
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,760
So there's uh three model 2022

540
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
scenarios panning out. And here is the

541
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,159
portion where we talk about index

542
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,960
futures.

543
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,679
So for Friday's Christmas mini and QQ

544
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,400
futures

545
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,799
over here on the left hand side we have

546
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,760
a daily chart and the five minute chart

547
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,000
for at present or NQ and I'm showcasing

548
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,679
it in the regular trading hours time and

549
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
I'm showing October 2nd. Okay. Uh, if

550
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,600
you recall, I was talking about and

551
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,520
mentioned on X how,

552
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,679
if I'm not mistaken, I think it's the

553
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,559
October 1st live stream I did where I

554
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,200
basically called the low, how it was

555
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,360
forming, showed you the liquidity that

556
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,880
was available, showed you exactly when

557
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,960
all the sell side was absorbed, and then

558
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,400
the market was going to be permitted to

559
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,039
trade higher, and even told you it could

560
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,679
create all-time new all-time highs. It

561
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,640
did all those things. But the point is I

562
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,960
was teaching you to take the regular

563
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,320
trading hours opening range gaps and

564
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,960
those quadrants that form and project

565
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,000
them in the future. At the very minimum,

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
if you're a little intimidated by what I

567
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
said earlier about having my PD rays

568
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,880
back as far as 60 days, I know some of

569
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
you pundits out there are going to be,

570
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,919
you know, chomping it a bit and you're

571
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,120
probably already typing it out in the

572
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,840
comment section of this video.

573
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,120
And you're welcome to say anything on

574
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,039
your last day. I if it's silliness, I

575
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,480
just, you know, broom me. I don't ever

576
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
see you again. But the uh the concept

577
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,559
will probably be something like that or

578
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,159
the con comment will be something like

579
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,840
this.

580
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,120
If you have enough of these lines on

581
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
there, of course, it's going to hit

582
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
something. But the problem is is I point

583
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,799
to the ones that it goes to and then my

584
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,039
trades are off of those levels. So it

585
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,279
it's a matter of experience. And what

586
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,880
you're going to discover is the ones

587
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,919
that are so obvious and they converge

588
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,080
and lay over top of or very very close

589
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,039
proximity to another supporting PD array

590
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
whether it be an inefficiency or a gap

591
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,080
like the wicks.

592
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,679
If it's laying on top of a quadrant

593
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
level like that and it's also time

594
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,559
anchored

595
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,200
if it's time for it to move it's at a a

596
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
session open. It's during the first 30

597
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
minutes of the opening range or it is

598
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,720
inside of a macro time.

599
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,440
Man, you have a loaded deal. And I don't

600
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
want you to believe me because I said

601
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,200
so. I know when I say something, the

602
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
community says, "Wow, if ICT says this,

603
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm just going to take that and just go

604
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,679
with it." Don't. Don't do that. You're

605
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,480
robbing yourself the opportunity to feel

606
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
the confidence that you know that you

607
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,760
know that you know. It's not good enough

608
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,640
for you to know that ICT knows.

609
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,200
It's good only in your hands if you know

610
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,279
that you know that you know. And you can

611
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,600
only get that confidence by seeing it in

612
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,080
your own hands. Go into your own charts

613
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,559
and then tape read it. Not trade it yet.

614
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,559
Tape read it. Watch and observe and

615
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,559
you'll see the market is absolutely

616
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,480
doing what I told you it would do. And

617
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,559
it's not just doing it once in a while.

618
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,880
Right now, the internet's a buzz. Oh,

619
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
where did this sell off come from?

620
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,679
Nobody saw this coming. Oh, a gasp.

621
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,600
Come on. Seriously. Listen. Okay. I've

622
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,640
already I've already um what is it?

623
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,919
Blocked. Okay. I'm a I got the banhammer

624
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,640
block um bionic thumb. You this fall

625
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,720
here. I I have no time for people that

626
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,679
are silly, stupid, or just ignorant. And

627
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,200
here here's here's what you have to

628
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
understand.

629
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
Number one, you're not entitled to know

630
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520
anything from me in advance. I'm out

631
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
here doing this because I like to do it.

632
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,039
I'm not selling you anything. I'm not a

633
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
course seller, okay? I'm not collecting

634
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,120
any money from you. I'm not asking for

635
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,640
your PayPal. I'm not asking for your

636
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,919
credit card payments. I'm not doing any

637
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,840
of that stuff. Have you noticed that?

638
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,440
Have you noticed it? Yeah. But there's a

639
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,400
lot of people out there that are

640
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,880
shilling my stuff and I still don't

641
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,559
stop. Why? Because you're not learning

642
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,880
correctly from them. You're just getting

643
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,279
crumbs from my table over here. I'm

644
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,320
serving fresh all the time. And I want

645
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,559
you to understand something. While I did

646
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,000
give advice to the average viewer that

647
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,360
you as an inexperienced individual, you

648
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,279
should never ever ever

649
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,720
entertain the idea of trying to pick a

650
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,200
top in the marketplace. It's a fool's

651
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,159
errand. It is simply

652
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,520
something that's going to hurt you more

653
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,720
than it will help you. Okay? And when I

654
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,919
was a 20-year-old, when I was first

655
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,200
learning about the markets, I thought

656
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,799
that it was possible to do it. I thought

657
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
Larry Williams was selling the high tick

658
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,080
and buying the bottom tick all the time.

659
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,760
He was my hero. I figured that's how he

660
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
did it. 10,000 to a million dollars in a

661
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,720
year. And it's not anything like that.

662
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,440
So, what I'm about to divulge to you is

663
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,799
20 years. Okay, I've been doing this for

664
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,320
33 years, but it was 20 years of

665
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,120
experience that led to this observation

666
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,919
and realization.

667
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,880
And prior to those 20 years bringing me

668
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,520
to this point of perspective, I hurt

669
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,640
myself a lot. I I just felt like I was

670
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,279
way better than I really was. And I kept

671
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,200
trying to fulfill this idea I had in my

672
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,919
mind where I can pick the tops. I can do

673
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,600
it. I I just had to tweak a little bit

674
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
of this and tweak a little bit of that.

675
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
Well, it just so happens that, you know,

676
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,520
I was on vacation with my wife just this

677
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
past week. We went to Cape Cod and we

678
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,679
stayed at U Bar Harbor in Maine. Now, I

679
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,120
know some of you this get you don't want

680
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,799
me to talk like this because I I go on

681
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,240
and on and you say I'm annoying and I

682
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
that's okay. I don't want you as a

683
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
student. Get the hell out of here. The

684
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,880
point is this. We were coming home and I

685
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,360
was watching NASDAQ all week and I told

686
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,679
my wife, I said, "Listen,

687
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,919
this thing's going to dump and trade

688
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,679
down a lot. It's Friday. They have

689
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,080
worked in so much staging for shorts,

690
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
for smart money, and I'll explain what

691
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,760
that is in a moment. And my wife looked

692
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,799
at me and she's like, "Okay, what's that

693
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,840
to me?" I don't care. That's what I

694
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,520
said. Let me tell you something. This

695
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,080
kind of move can pay for Christmas and

696
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,600
this vacation and everything. Like

697
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,880
that's how big this thing's going to

698
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
move. Well,

699
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,039
my wife's never impressed by this

700
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,399
because she she still thinks it's a a

701
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,960
video game. It doesn't matter how much

702
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,039
money you ever make. The point is it's

703
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
still a video game to her. So, she

704
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,080
thinks like a lady that is not

705
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,600
interested. And that's not a knock

706
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
against her or anything. It's just she's

707
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
remained consistent the entire time

708
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,960
we've been together. So just understand

709
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,600
this gentlemen. If your wife is not

710
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
impressed by your success doing this,

711
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
don't feel bad. You're you're you're

712
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,679
among good company.

713
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,159
Okay? Trust me when I tell you that. So

714
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,520
let's talk about how I expected this

715
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,960
measure of retracement but was surprised

716
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,600
that it happened in one day. like it was

717
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,520
a lot of movement in one day. I expected

718
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
this to kind of like bleed over into

719
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,200
next week and it still might do that,

720
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,559
but it just really overd delivered. And

721
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,440
I want you to go back to again the post

722
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,039
I was making about Thursday,

723
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,080
October 2nd, and I told you to take

724
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,559
those levels. The apt student would

725
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,279
carry those over into the the right side

726
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,080
of their chart and keep keep extending

727
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,679
them to the right.

728
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,320
I'm going to kind of like break that

729
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
down and decode that for you. I'm going

730
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
to remove the mystic the mystery and and

731
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,799
mysticism around why I was talking about

732
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,480
it.

733
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,960
If you go to your daily chart and we had

734
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,559
our old all-time high here, okay, they

735
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,960
formed as relative equal highs. This

736
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
high being slightly lower than that one.

737
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,200
So that classifies this as a high

738
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,480
probability candidate for a run on

739
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,159
liquidity.

740
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,240
It's less likely when the right side is

741
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
higher than the left because we've

742
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,679
already done the damage there by running

743
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,240
the wick of this candlestick. So, we

744
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
created this short-term all-time high

745
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,840
and we traded lower. Okay? And you can

746
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,520
look at your daily chart and we'll see

747
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,360
it in a moment when I show the bigger

748
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,440
portion of this. But for now, don't look

749
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,799
at chart yet. Just follow along with

750
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,120
this one. And then we had this

751
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,799
candlestick here. We pierced it, but

752
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,120
look, we only pierced it with a wick.

753
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,000
That's not meaningful to me. It's

754
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,640
insignificant. It's unfinished business

755
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,039
still above this candlestick high. So on

756
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,760
this day here, we have October 2nd. The

757
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,880
market creates this open. We trade down

758
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,720
and we rally up

759
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,559
here and then come off the high right

760
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,159
there. The this day

761
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,960
October 2nd regular trading hours

762
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
opening range gap. That's what this five

763
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,080
minute chart has been showcasing.

764
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,519
Okay. So these levels here

765
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,279
are what I was referring to.

766
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,519
They need to be carried into the future.

767
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,919
Why did I say that?

768
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,799
Why not any other

769
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,440
being specifically mentioned?

770
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,679
I said in the October 1st that you

771
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,960
should look back over the last three

772
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,799
days.

773
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,039
Always. If you have opening range level

774
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,440
quadrants on your chart,

775
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,880
go back over the last three days and

776
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,799
include them.

777
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,640
So technically you're going to have

778
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
whatever the trading day that you're

779
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,720
trading that opening range gap if there

780
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,919
is one in its quadrants and then one two

781
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,559
three days ago. So what do you have in

782
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,120
your charts technically four opening

783
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,880
range gaps and their respective

784
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
quadrants.

785
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,320
So when I say you have to have three on

786
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,559
there, it's not just three sets of

787
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,559
opening range quadrants.

788
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,960
today's trading day and whatever opening

789
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,640
range gap quadrants there may be

790
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,159
associated with it and then yesterday

791
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,440
the day before it and the day before it

792
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,679
and you have to go back into the

793
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,440
previous week if you're looking at like

794
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,360
say for instance on Monday you'll go

795
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,919
back to Friday Thursday and Wednesday of

796
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,519
the previous week if there's a holiday

797
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,880
you're going to skip over that and just

798
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,679
go to the market day that uh price was

799
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,880
permitted to trade in

800
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,559
this Today we have a body left above the

801
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,760
previous all-time highs. This right here

802
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,960
is much more meaningful. So this day's

803
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,760
opening range gap is going to be highly

804
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
highly significant.

805
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,440
That's why I told you to carry it and go

806
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,919
forward projecting it forward. And

807
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
you'll look at all these days here and

808
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,679
you'll see those levels which are these

809
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,399
levels here. They're being used by the

810
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,320
algorithm that you don't believe exists.

811
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,240
But everybody knows about opening range

812
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,840
gaps. It's always been a thing ICT.

813
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,120
I didn't say I invented a gap opening. I

814
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,360
didn't say that. I just created a

815
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,519
language how you can take advantage of

816
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,200
it and trade precision entries and exits

817
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,840
and scale in build your positions larger

818
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,760
trail your stop loss appropriately and

819
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
properly.

820
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,120
That's what I promise to teach. Nobody

821
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
else does that. Now, they might have

822
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,720
interpretations,

823
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,880
but they don't have it like I got it.

824
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,360
And these levels are what you should

825
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,480
have on your chart. And this is a video

826
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,639
where you want to probably pause this

827
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,760
video right here. Go and get your levels

828
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,320
on the opening range gap for October

829
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,839
2nd.

830
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,440
Okay? And then study the third, the

831
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,520
fourth, fifth, you know, so on until we

832
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,599
made this high up here.

833
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,960
Notice how it was used all in this area

834
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
here.

835
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,320
And you're going to see that there's a

836
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,440
lot of wonderful confirmations, setups,

837
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
stop-loss management ideas that could

838
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,159
have been utilized and implemented. Lots

839
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,800
of scalps, lots of wonderful scalps. And

840
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
I teased even while I was away that look

841
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,560
at this. Even today, it still used the

842
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,359
upper quadrant. Even then, it used this,

843
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,040
it used that.

844
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,200
because I'm I'm poking and I'm proddding

845
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,440
you to consider this information because

846
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,599
it's not contrived. It's not random.

847
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,440
It's not made up. It's not borrowed

848
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,000
logic from anything else.

849
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,520
Okay? It's my life's work. So, the

850
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,320
candlestick that left a body above old

851
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,359
time all-time highs, this logic also

852
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,880
works when it's not trading all-time

853
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,599
highs. But I've learned 20 years into my

854
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,680
career that this is something that tends

855
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,560
to repeat at all-time highs. Now, I've

856
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,839
only had a few instances in certain

857
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,160
markets to see all-time highs form. I've

858
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,359
only been around for 53 years, but in my

859
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,240
53 years on this spinning rock, that's a

860
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,920
sphere, not a flat surface. By the way,

861
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,280
flat earth, you're wrong. the idea of a

862
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,320
body being left above that old all-time

863
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,480
high. This could be still used if it's

864
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,599
just a old market high. If you're

865
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,800
looking for the market to trade above an

866
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,839
old all-time high, it's this logic and

867
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,160
any old high where we look at this

868
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,720
candlestick, it leaves a body above it.

869
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Whereas, by contrast, this one only

870
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,839
wicks above it by a little bit. So, I

871
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,119
want you to understand there's a

872
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,640
significant departure from just simply

873
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
going above it price-wise and then

874
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,200
leaving the body above it. Okay, this is

875
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,040
much more salient and more information

876
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
being

877
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,599
indicating that the algorithm will now

878
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,760
utilize that candlestick's opening range

879
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,000
gap levels

880
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,640
and that's these levels here. Okay, I

881
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,200
also show this uh lower quadrant here.

882
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,839
You'll see this in the chart uh slides

883
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,480
as I go forward. It's perfect position

884
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,720
here. Why am I picking this one? Because

885
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,960
it's the highest one in this swing high

886
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,040
lower quadrant. Trades it, hits it

887
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,520
perfectly, and sells off on that day of

888
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,760
October 2nd, 2025.

889
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,599
But now watch what happens. I want you

890
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,320
to pay attention to the daily chart over

891
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,520
here. We have a buy sign on a balance

892
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,599
sell efficiency

893
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,280
volume of bounce toward the discount end

894
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,160
of that bissy and it's candlesticks low

895
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,480
as the high

896
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,119
graded. Here's the upper quadrant.

897
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,599
consequent encroachment lower quadrant

898
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,760
and then the low.

899
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,480
This portion here

900
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,800
of that blue box is being shown right

901
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,839
down here.

902
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,160
The buy side equity pool here is this

903
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,400
blue line right there. So that way we

904
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,359
can track everything.

905
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,000
Thursday regular trading hours opening

906
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,079
range gap

907
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,119
lower quadrant.

908
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,119
This is the opening range gap low on

909
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,200
that Thursday. That's this black line

910
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,440
here.

911
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,480
Consequent encroachment of Tuesday,

912
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,560
October 2nd opening range gap.

913
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,440
Here's the upper quadrant.

914
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
And here's the high of Thursday's

915
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,920
opening range gap. High.

916
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,880
That's what's being shown here. Okay.

917
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,200
over here.

918
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,720
This candlestick here on the 2nd of

919
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,760
October has a little arrow above it.

920
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,200
That closing price. Okay. Everything I'm

921
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,640
saying here when you're looking at

922
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,680
markets trading at lows that you

923
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,480
anticipate trading below an old low and

924
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,560
looking for accumulation to go higher,

925
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,680
you're going to reverse everything I'm

926
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,440
saying here. But for now, I'm focusing

927
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,240
on how we can

928
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,880
not predict. I'm not trying to promise

929
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,920
you're going to be able to call the high

930
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,599
in the marketplace. I didn't get at the

931
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,359
high, but I'm showcasing how you can see

932
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,400
real accumulation and real distribution

933
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,400
in the marketplace. Okay?

934
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,160
Bodies left above old highs right there.

935
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
that closing price. As soon as that day

936
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,880
closes and a new one opens here, that

937
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,440
price right there and anything above it,

938
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,400
smart money will start staging

939
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,960
shorts.

940
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,680
If we're making an all-time high or if

941
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,760
we're making a long-term high or a

942
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,280
significant intermediate term high and

943
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
we expect to see a a decline that's

944
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,880
tradable,

945
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,200
you want to reference in the market when

946
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,280
it's bullish. If you're anticipating a

947
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,000
turnaround, you want to indicate every

948
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,720
up close price,

949
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,400
the the closing price. That's what I'm

950
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,359
indicating here. So October 2nd, 2025,

951
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,960
this price is what's being indicated,

952
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,920
which now appears here on this chart.

953
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,800
So everything at that price and above,

954
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,079
smart money is looking for PD arrays to

955
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,480
get short on. They're running out old

956
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,800
highs, selling into that. They're

957
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,680
selling into that. They're building

958
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,599
large portions because they have to act

959
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,040
like a commercial trader does in

960
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,320
commodities. They enter early.

961
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,680
When big positions are uh sought after,

962
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,000
they start putting in positions early.

963
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,400
Where do they and how do they do that?

964
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,320
Everything above this closing price,

965
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,920
anything above that price is going to be

966
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,640
chased by what? Retail.

967
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,280
But when they're buying it, smart money

968
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,160
is selling to them as they buy. So at

969
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,560
this point here and above to this

970
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,440
candlestick here, all this is where

971
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,079
smart money is accumulating swing

972
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,240
trading perspective that kind like like

973
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,440
a duration of time, not a day trade. In

974
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
other words, they're staging in that

975
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,599
range shorts.

976
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,520
And then we get this day. We have a

977
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
higher close price than the previous

978
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,200
one.

979
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,359
See that? So now above that price

980
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,680
and higher up to here, Smart Money is

981
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,400
looking for PDAs, old highs to sell into

982
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,040
when it goes above it or trading back up

983
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,680
into premium arrays. They're selling

984
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,599
short inside that area. And then

985
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,119
finally, we have this closing price

986
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,640
here. So, we have one, two, three stages

987
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,960
of smart money shorting.

988
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,640
They're staging their short positions.

989
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,520
As the market's going higher,

990
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,480
they're feeding

991
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,920
that buy liquidity

992
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,079
to the people that want to chase price

993
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,240
higher. They keep Oh, it's going to keep

994
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
going higher. You can see what they're

995
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,240
doing with the candlestick wicks.

996
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,000
See that?

997
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yeah, we were here at this highest point

998
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
here, but we closed down here. Yeah, we

999
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,480
were high up here, but we closed right

1000
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,240
here. We were high up here, but we

1001
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,640
closed way down here. We We are high

1002
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,880
here, but we closed right there. That's

1003
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,640
distribution

1004
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,079
of longs and accumulation of shorts by

1005
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,240
Smart Money.

1006
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
Now, this is not a one-time video and

1007
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,440
you understand it. Please, young men, do

1008
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,960
not go out there and pretend. Did you

1009
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,560
understand what I just said? It's going

1010
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,520
to take you a little bit of time

1011
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,800
studying your own charts and studying

1012
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
what price action is doing when it does

1013
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,400
these types of things. But do not think

1014
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,560
like this only with all-time highs.

1015
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,000
Every time the market creates

1016
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,160
intermediate term or long-term highs, it

1017
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,359
does these same things.

1018
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,599
It does these same things. But at

1019
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,200
all-time highs, you want to see an

1020
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,280
all-time high form and then a deep

1021
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,160
retracement and then it gets taken out

1022
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,599
and then start looking for these types

1023
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,760
of scenarios. Okay. So here we have this

1024
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,079
portion here at this candlesticks

1025
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,839
closing price and anything above it

1026
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,960
they're going to be utilizing

1027
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,240
premium arrays and selling short above

1028
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,440
old highs because they have deep pockets

1029
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,480
because they are essentially

1030
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,040
agents of the market where they're

1031
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,119
literally privy to certain things.

1032
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,480
They don't have to have the same

1033
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
concerns that you have to have. You want

1034
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,400
to trade big positions, very, very small

1035
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
stop- losses.

1036
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,400
They don't need to worry about that type

1037
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,240
of stuff because they're not

1038
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,760
overleveraging.

1039
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,599
They're scaling in. They're scaling in.

1040
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,119
They're scaling in. Now, time element.

1041
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,200
It's Friday. We're at all-time highs

1042
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,560
on Thursday. We open up on Friday. We

1043
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,599
trade up

1044
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,160
into that Thursday high. and we grade

1045
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,760
that. Okay, upper quadrant's pierced,

1046
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,400
but we can't get to the high of it. And

1047
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,520
we trade lower.

1048
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,040
As it starts to trade lower,

1049
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,560
everybody's talking about the comment

1050
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,680
that Trump made about the 100%

1051
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,160
tariff on China.

1052
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,280
And that news is the

1053
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,880
justification.

1054
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,680
It's the excuse. It's the the news moved

1055
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,680
the market. Trump's moving the market.

1056
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,240
Trump is not moving the market. I

1057
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,119
promise you, this guy is looked at as

1058
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,079
some kind of messiah. He ain't. The

1059
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,040
bottom line is this.

1060
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,560
It is not what he says,

1061
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,160
it's what the market's doing before he

1062
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,920
speaks.

1063
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,160
And then all the excuse, all the blame,

1064
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,000
all the

1065
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,240
well, that's the reason why that retail

1066
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,200
can see it. And that helps them sleep at

1067
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,640
night knowing that their trend lines

1068
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
didn't work or their moving average

1069
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,280
crossovers didn't work anymore or their

1070
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,839
divergences or their indicators didn't

1071
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,800
avail them a win. It didn't communicate

1072
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,720
any clarity to them. So, it makes

1073
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,240
perfect sense that it's mean old Trump.

1074
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,880
He manipulated the market because he

1075
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,359
said this

1076
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,960
when I'm going to show you it's not that

1077
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,760
at all. But it makes perfect sense to a

1078
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,560
neophite. It's a perfect blame game for

1079
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,400
someone that doesn't know how these

1080
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,480
markets operate and how they book price.

1081
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,400
It's a perfect excuse for them not to

1082
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,880
know why it didn't indicate before it

1083
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,200
was going to go down. It's a perfect

1084
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,560
excuse for someone that's weak-minded,

1085
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,720
that's insecure as a young man on social

1086
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,640
media that doesn't want to listen to

1087
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,119
someone with 33 years of experience that

1088
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,680
literally does it, that went out there

1089
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,520
on live stream and told you beforehand

1090
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,640
this is what it was going to do and it

1091
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,200
did it to the tick.

1092
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
You have a choice. You can listen to me

1093
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,480
or you can not listen to me. But why

1094
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,680
waste your time if you're not going to

1095
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,400
listen? Because I'm not going to fail at

1096
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,680
this. I'm not going to fail. I keep

1097
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,760
making more millionaires, more

1098
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,480
successful students. And I talk about it

1099
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
as it happens.

1100
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,680
I talk about it before it happens. I

1101
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
explain it in detail why it will repeat

1102
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,760
in the future. So that way you can do

1103
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,319
it, not just, "Wow, he did that. He did

1104
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,240
this. He can do that." It's not about

1105
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,040
me. Take me out of this. Take you and

1106
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,079
put you in it. Can you see yourself

1107
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,480
doing this? You will never be able to do

1108
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,760
it unless you stop listening to fools

1109
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
and you roll your sleeves up and you do

1110
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,920
your own due diligence and study it,

1111
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,240
back test it, look at old price moves.

1112
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,200
So, let's move a little bit forward now.

1113
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,760
So, we jump ahead and we're looking at

1114
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,800
Tuesday

1115
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,599
price action. We open up higher again.

1116
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,119
This uh is a five-minute chart on

1117
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,040
NASDAQ. Usually I show like a one minute

1118
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,760
chart, but for the sake of sizing and

1119
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,280
showing more data, I'm using the

1120
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,680
five-minute chart. We have a small gap

1121
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,599
in here. So, it's regular trading hours

1122
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,040
being shown. And the idea is that we see

1123
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,839
it trade lower

1124
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,359
above that this closing price. So, we we

1125
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,040
use that price here. So, there's

1126
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,119
discount sensitivity. It rallies above

1127
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,440
previous high here. So what's above that

1128
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,599
buy side? So they're selling into that.

1129
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,160
They're selling into that. We come back

1130
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,000
down into that October 6 closing price.

1131
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,400
Then we have a gap opening higher. We

1132
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
rally above previous high. Then we sell

1133
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,800
off.

1134
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,119
Small little civian here. Sells off and

1135
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,800
trades down into what? Thursday's

1136
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,520
regular trading hours opening range gap

1137
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,920
low. That's this dark line right here.

1138
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,000
You'll see it annotated in a moment.

1139
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,680
Here's the lower quadrant. Here's

1140
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,280
consequent encouragement. Here's the

1141
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,920
upper quadrant. Here's the high of it,

1142
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,400
which is the opening price on Thursday,

1143
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,880
October 2nd. So, don't be confused with

1144
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,240
these annotations. I'm referring to only

1145
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,240
October 2nd. Why? Because it was the

1146
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,800
candlestick that had the body that was

1147
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,760
left above the previous all-time high

1148
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,359
when it formed and then retraced away

1149
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,440
from it. Really, really important. And

1150
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,560
you're going to need to watch and listen

1151
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,480
to this video a few times, but then go

1152
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,160
back and look at your old price moves.

1153
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,680
It doesn't need to be all-time highs,

1154
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,760
and you'll see exactly what I'm saying

1155
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,440
is the truth. And there has never been

1156
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,319
ever ever never ever ever ever been

1157
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,400
another author, teacher, educator,

1158
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,800
trader that ever talked about it, shared

1159
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,560
it, or ever communicated, or even hinted

1160
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,359
at it. Not one time in history ever in

1161
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,880
print, video format, or audible.

1162
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,240
And that's the truth. And today, October

1163
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,720
11, 2025, good old Michael J.

1164
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,400
Huddleston,

1165
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,520
ICT, inner circle trader, is giving it

1166
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,480
to you for free. Why? Because I don't

1167
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,760
need your effing money. I don't need it.

1168
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,839
I don't need your money. And for some of

1169
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,839
you, that just pisses you off because

1170
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,119
you want to be able to say, "I got a

1171
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,040
shill. I got to get my bills paid. And

1172
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,760
I'm out here giving it for free over and

1173
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,200
over and over again. I'm like the

1174
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,880
candyman." And guess what they say about

1175
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,800
the candyman? The candyman can I can

1176
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,880
here look at the levels it's using the

1177
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,760
upper quadrant here

1178
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,839
hits it sells off lower than that it's

1179
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,280
the consequent encroachment level look

1180
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,880
at the body respecting it there and

1181
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,640
trades down to lower quadrant and then

1182
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,839
to the low of it this is literally

1183
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,920
five days

1184
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,520
after October 2nd why is the price

1185
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,079
respecting these levels

1186
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,440
Find that in support and resistance

1187
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,599
theory. It's not going to be found. Find

1188
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,440
it in white. It's not going to be found.

1189
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,520
Supply and demand. Find it. It will not

1190
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,440
be found. It's not an Elliot wave.

1191
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,040
Pitchforks ain't nowhere near to be

1192
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,520
seen.

1193
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,680
Moving average crossovers. Nope. No

1194
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,880
flags. No penants.

1195
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,480
No regression channels.

1196
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,640
None of that nonsense. No harmonic

1197
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,880
patterns. No animal patterns, zoo

1198
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,599
patterns, none of that stuff. It's a

1199
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,559
simple grading of very specific generic

1200
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,119
ideas when you understand the market's

1201
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,319
algorithmically delivered.

1202
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,319
It's a very simplistic approach to

1203
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,079
understanding why price is going to do

1204
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,760
what it's going to do and when it should

1205
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,760
do it. when

1206
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,880
look at the times when price is hitting

1207
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,200
these levels.

1208
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,680
There's the epiphany.

1209
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,440
You're going to love it. But if you're

1210
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,240
never looking for it, it goes under the

1211
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,040
radar. And that's why every Tom Dick and

1212
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,880
Harry

1213
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,200
and Jane Doe

1214
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,920
educator never noticed it before because

1215
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,280
they don't believe there's a central

1216
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,960
algorithm that runs everything. They

1217
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,920
believe it's buying and selling

1218
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,160
pressures. Therefore, it must be random.

1219
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,200
It's a randomly evenly distributed

1220
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,440
random act of chaos of buying and

1221
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,200
selling. We all are doing auction

1222
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,800
theory.

1223
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,280
No, you're not.

1224
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,640
No, you're not. You're following a Judas

1225
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,400
either to slaughter or you soon will be.

1226
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,880
That's what retail is doing. And that's

1227
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,800
all they're ever doing. But they're

1228
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,000
given all this wonderful distractions to

1229
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,559
be able to classify and say, "I'm smart

1230
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,040
because I know this trading model. I'm

1231
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,720
using this trading approach. I'm using

1232
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,160
this indicator and this school of

1233
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,839
thought and I use this guy because he

1234
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,440
wrote books about this or this person

1235
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,280
made this or this person won a contest

1236
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,880
using this or therefore it must validate

1237
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,839
it and it doesn't hold water." Like I

1238
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,119
said, you can flip a coin buy and heads

1239
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,520
short on tails if you use sound money

1240
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,119
management and don't overleverage or

1241
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,680
overtrade. you can make money.

1242
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,599
It doesn't sound like it's possible to

1243
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,000
the neophite, to the uninitiated, to

1244
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,599
someone that has no idea what's going

1245
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,599
on.

1246
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,040
There's no way that that could possibly

1247
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,000
happen, but yet it does.

1248
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,839
But what will happen is someone will

1249
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,440
bring their own twist to it. They can't

1250
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,079
follow those rules. They got to well the

1251
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,680
last time I looked at this price like

1252
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,359
this and the last time I got in a fight

1253
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,200
with my spouse and last time I had gout

1254
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,880
and last time I had athletes foot and

1255
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,559
last time my back was aching and elbow

1256
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,720
hurt. I had tennis elbow. I had this and

1257
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,559
I had that. You know the market did this

1258
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,200
and the other thing happened.

1259
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,960
You bring in human failed logic

1260
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,359
and it's what people do all the time. I

1261
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,640
can give you literally enigma. I can

1262
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,800
give it to you and you'll lose money

1263
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,880
with it. Not because it's not perfect,

1264
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,720
but because you want to make something

1265
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,880
in your own hands with it. You want to

1266
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,119
say you found something, you discovered

1267
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,319
something, you want to be authenticated

1268
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,200
because you contributed something. And

1269
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,920
that's the big thing right now. And a

1270
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,119
lot of you young people just need to be

1271
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,599
thankful that you're even learning it.

1272
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,319
Not enigma, but how the markets actually

1273
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,200
book. There's so many of you out there

1274
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,400
that simply can't give honor to whom

1275
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,359
it's due.

1276
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,040
That's God. Because that's who gave it

1277
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,079
to me. That's who gave it to me.

1278
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,599
So keep shelling. Keep doing all that

1279
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,440
nonsense you're doing because nobody's

1280
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,079
going to remember your name. Nobody's

1281
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,079
going to remember your name. They might

1282
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,240
see you right now talking in the

1283
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,480
language that I gave you, but they're

1284
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,880
not going to remember you.

1285
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,280
You got suckers on the on the the meal

1286
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,599
ride right now paying you. But that's

1287
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,480
going to dry up. And when it does,

1288
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,680
nobody will remember you.

1289
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,480
Nobody will. And that's going to hurt.

1290
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,240
It's going to ache cuz that's what you

1291
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,640
really want. Cuz money is easy. Money's

1292
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,559
it's fleeting. You get it, you got it,

1293
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,040
you spend it, it's gone.

1294
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,280
But for all you out there that are

1295
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,960
selling and marketing and trying to make

1296
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,800
a name for yourself, you want legacy.

1297
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,599
You want legendary status.

1298
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,680
I don't want it. I don't want it.

1299
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,000
But you're never going to get it.

1300
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,960
You're never going to get it.

1301
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,440
>> It's delicious. Actually, moving forward

1302
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,000
here, we have Wednesday, October 8th.

1303
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,160
Now, we're above the October 6th closing

1304
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,000
price. That's over here. All these

1305
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,839
wicks, we're seeing that form in here.

1306
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,480
So everything in this price run up here.

1307
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,559
Again, every time price runs above this

1308
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,200
high there, Smart Money is staging.

1309
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,440
They're adding to their short position.

1310
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,040
This high here, as it trades above it,

1311
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,359
they're adding to their short position

1312
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,280
here. This high, as it trades above it,

1313
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,000
they're shorting more up here, they're

1314
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,599
shorting. What is this?

1315
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,400
It's an inversion fair gap. Price breaks

1316
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
that low, trades down. There's your

1317
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,160
short inside of another fair value gap

1318
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,599
there. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1319
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,559
delivery there. Trades back down. What's

1320
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,520
it trade down to? Tuesday, October 2nd,

1321
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,079
2025, regular trading hours, opening

1322
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,760
price. That's the high of that opening

1323
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,800
range gap on October 2nd. Hits it and

1324
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,240
what does it do? Stop. It flirts just

1325
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,880
below it a little bit with the wicks and

1326
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,760
then rallies away.

1327
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,200
Why is it using that level? If the

1328
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,920
algorithm doesn't exist, why is it using

1329
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,319
now something six days old? The data has

1330
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,480
already been used. It's already been

1331
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,400
referred to. It's already closed its

1332
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,000
gap.

1333
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,200
Here's the third. It traded down and and

1334
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,599
threw it.

1335
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,359
So why is it still using it?

1336
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,280
Everybody knows about GAPS. this guy.

1337
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,559
ICT, what a fraud.

1338
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,640
He's rebranding. Uh, no.

1339
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,240
I'm trailblazing.

1340
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,760
And you're all having the wonderful

1341
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,839
opportunity to watch it as it happens.

1342
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,000
You're all having a GAN moment. You're

1343
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,440
all watching a Livermore moment.

1344
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,040
That's not ego. It's just simple facts.

1345
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,079
And now here we are. Here we are. Dday.

1346
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,040
Here

1347
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,880
it is

1348
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,520
the market on the 9th. Here's Thursday

1349
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,000
creating the high.

1350
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,960
Okay,

1351
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,440
we have the market trading

1352
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,799
in an area where

1353
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,160
the October closing price here on the

1354
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,040
ETH the 9th we open, we rally up in this

1355
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,480
little portion of price action in here.

1356
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,880
All this that's being graded up here.

1357
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,000
You can see those levels here at 25,393.

1358
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,799
even that's this candlestick's high.

1359
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,240
Okay. So it's pre over here previous

1360
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,720
looking at it

1361
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,359
the bodies are stopping rate of

1362
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,280
consequent encroachment

1363
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,040
right here and we're above buy side on

1364
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,960
this swing high here deep retracement.

1365
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,359
It trades down into what I tell you

1366
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,680
Thursday's regular trading hours opening

1367
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,520
price. So that was the high of the

1368
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,359
opening range gap on Thursday October

1369
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,799
2nd.

1370
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,799
The only reason why we're constantly

1371
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,720
keeping these levels on our chart is

1372
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,400
because on the daily chart, it was

1373
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,760
October 2nd that left the higher bodied

1374
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,599
closing price above the previous swing

1375
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,280
high that made all-time highs.

1376
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,720
Carry that over into when you're not

1377
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,160
trading all-time highs, just using it

1378
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,880
for market structure purposes.

1379
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,040
When you're trading above an old high

1380
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,559
and you're expecting a long-term or

1381
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,559
intermediate term high to form, you're

1382
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,839
using the same logic.

1383
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,920
It just works more frequently because

1384
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,680
it's rare that the markets that you're

1385
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,760
trading are at all-time highs. It takes

1386
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,839
a lot of time to get to these all-time

1387
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,559
highs in markets. So, here we have it.

1388
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,079
So,

1389
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,400
point is the market's already indicating

1390
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
it's tipping its hand. the bodies are

1391
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,400
not able to close above consequent

1392
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,079
encroachment

1393
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,400
of the ninth price action.

1394
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,960
So when we start trading on the 10th

1395
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,920
here,

1396
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,640
it's it's faltering. It's failing. It

1397
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,680
can't muster up the strength

1398
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,440
to get into a run to make a higher

1399
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,280
all-time high.

1400
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,000
And we've had three stages of smart

1401
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,640
money shorting.

1402
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:36,160
This price that is too far to the left

1403
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,079
is the old buy side. It trades above it

1404
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,920
here. That's your first indication that

1405
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,000
we laid down a body and a closing price

1406
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,079
at a all-time high. Above a old all-time

1407
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,319
high that was a swing high. So here's a

1408
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,839
stage one. Here's stage two and stage

1409
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,280
three. Anything

1410
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,680
above those closing prices, smart money

1411
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,720
is putting in shorts. They're selling.

1412
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,000
They're selling to the public. They're

1413
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,960
selling to money chasers,

1414
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,400
the Johnny come lately, the breakout

1415
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,160
artists, the Instagram traders, the Tik

1416
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,720
Tok traders, the YouTubers. They're

1417
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,400
buying on breakouts. They're buying

1418
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,839
strength. They think it's going to go to

1419
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,760
the moon. All this is it's going to the

1420
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,799
moon. It's going to the moon. Just like

1421
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,160
Bitcoin, it's going to the moon. It's

1422
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,480
going to the moon.

1423
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,160
doesn't

1424
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,960
market trades right back above right in

1425
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,240
here above buy side here and taps

1426
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,119
October 8th 2025's closing price

1427
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,359
after just a hair pierce above

1428
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,960
And then it happens

1429
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,079
inversion fairway. I got small little

1430
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,799
invol um volume and bounce in here.

1431
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,359
You'll check your price to see it. It's

1432
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,160
very small but it's there.

1433
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,799
Market trades up.

1434
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,119
It's all out of bed.

1435
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,079
three stages of smart money selling

1436
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,880
above an all-time high

1437
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,839
indicated by failure by the body's not

1438
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,240
making any headway above consequent

1439
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,240
encouragement.

1440
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,839
If it would have been above it then we

1441
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,319
might have to make a higher high but

1442
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,760
it's not. And I taught you this. I

1443
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,400
taught you this. This is how you read

1444
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,359
orderflow. It's not level two nonsense

1445
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:44,880
where you're looking at numbers and

1446
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,400
attribute that to some kind of

1447
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,079
prognostication for the future. It has

1448
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,359
nothing to do with it because there's

1449
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,240
orders above and below. That ladder is

1450
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,000
not going to be helpful in terms of

1451
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,680
direction. It's your in private

1452
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,839
interpretation is what you're you're

1453
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,839
believing in the religion that you

1454
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,400
created for yourself. But when you start

1455
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,240
seeing the science that I'm showing you

1456
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,799
here and the closing prices are giving

1457
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,200
telltale signs to smart money that it's

1458
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,680
about to turn.

1459
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,920
Why? Because we couldn't post a body

1460
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,240
above consequent encouragement of this

1461
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,240
wick and it's time

1462
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,240
Friday.

1463
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,839
Oh, it looks like a bull flag or a

1464
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:29,440
bullish continuation penant.

1465
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,920
really

1466
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,319
reversion fair value gap

1467
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,280
failure to go higher.

1468
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,680
We're consolidating and then we go into

1469
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,440
the macro

1470
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,280
1050 11:10 a.m. overlapping with London

1471
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,040
close.

1472
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,119
Look at your euro. Look at your dollar

1473
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,440
index and look at your pound dollar

1474
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,440
again.

1475
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,440
Then market starts to drop.

1476
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,200
People are in shock.

1477
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,400
Social media is ablaze. What's going on?

1478
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,599
Trump. Trump did this. Trump said that.

1479
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,520
Trump said Trump this. He's the fault

1480
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,200
guy. I told you in 2016 he would be used

1481
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,400
as such before he was even elected. And

1482
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,240
before you come at me, I have never

1483
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,440
voted in my life. I've never voted for

1484
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,240
anyone because it's

1485
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,400
a facade.

1486
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,760
You're a victim of the left right

1487
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,079
paradigm and no matter what side you

1488
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,920
pick,

1489
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,160
you're still being deceived because you

1490
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:43,319
don't have a say in the matter. If they

1491
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,920
voting mattered,

1492
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,200
they would never ever let you do it. So,

1493
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,040
I'm not trying to promote an idea one

1494
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,640
side or the next. I'm not Republican.

1495
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,040
I'm not Democrat. I'm not independent.

1496
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,640
I'm a monarchist. I'm looking for a

1497
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,559
coming king.

1498
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,960
He's not of this world. So, my

1499
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,680
perspective is completely objective

1500
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,079
outside of I'm not looking at it through

1501
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,839
the lens of a party view. But I told you

1502
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,000
in 2016 that everything you're seeing

1503
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,760
all around the world and in the US, it

1504
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,880
was coming and it's here. I told you it

1505
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,920
was going to be expensive and you won't

1506
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,960
be able to pay for food. You won't be

1507
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,920
able to do this. You won't be able to do

1508
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,760
that. It's happening. I tell you about

1509
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,720
this in the market. I tell you about

1510
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,920
that in the market. This is what it's

1511
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,119
going to do. Is it what it's not going

1512
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,240
to do? It's going to say

1513
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,839
it wants to go higher with certain

1514
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,599
things, but retail will chase that and

1515
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,160
it'll be wrong.

1516
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,160
We're in the age of deception right now.

1517
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,240
And you need to make sure you guard

1518
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,160
yourself against that.

1519
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,520
And because I'm a man

1520
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,039
and you got to make sure that no man

1521
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,640
deceives you, don't take my word for it.

1522
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,319
Go into your charts and get your

1523
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,880
evidence there.

1524
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,880
Period.

1525
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,559
So, here's where we're at. inversion

1526
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,280
fair gap macro 1050 1110

1527
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,039
trading at the closing prices third

1528
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,119
stage of smart money shorting at

1529
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,280
all-time high and one more tap into that

1530
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,760
buy side and it carines lower

1531
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,920
and back into that Thursday those

1532
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,240
Thursday levels we trade down below

1533
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,480
consequent encroachment of Thursday

1534
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,720
October 2nd 2025's opening range gap it

1535
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,240
wicks

1536
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,559
through it twice. Where is the bodies

1537
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,559
below it?

1538
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:40,240
Why am I using that Thursday, October

1539
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,720
2nd opening range gap? Because it's the

1540
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,240
one it's the one that had the daily

1541
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,839
candlestick close that laid down a new

1542
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,400
all-time high above a previous all-time

1543
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,799
high that was formed that was retraced

1544
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,680
on. So, it should be viewed as what?

1545
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,319
Continuation. But I'm looking for

1546
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,480
indications that smart money will fade

1547
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:06,359
into that and start selling it

1548
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,039
distribution here inside this cibby

1549
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,680
volume and balance.

1550
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,839
I'm a balance.

1551
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,920
This is what

1552
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,480
suspension block

1553
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,720
halfway point consequent encroachment

1554
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,760
can't even reach that and the bodies are

1555
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,720
staying below what Thursday's

1556
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,559
regular trading hours opening range gap

1557
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,039
consequent encroachment midpoint level.

1558
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,960
It can't even muster the strength to

1559
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,640
come back and kiss it with its bodies.

1560
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,319
It's weird. It's heavy. So, where could

1561
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,240
it reach for? Go back to your daily

1562
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,240
chart.

1563
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,960
We have a swing low. We have a discount

1564
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,799
wick that you can grade. And then we

1565
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,240
have the change in the state delivery

1566
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,079
down here. See this down close candle

1567
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,440
all the way past this one. So, if we're

1568
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,920
going to pierce this, this is the last

1569
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,359
time after or before this candlestick

1570
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,200
formed. This was the last time there's a

1571
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,359
change in state delivery. So this candle

1572
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,440
sticks open

1573
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,400
to its high. That is your premium wick.

1574
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,440
When price is above it, it's going to

1575
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,359
act as what? A discount wick. So here's

1576
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,200
the lower quadrant consequent

1577
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,359
encouragement. And the upper quadrant.

1578
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,440
Lower quadrant comes in at 24,16650.

1579
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,440
And during regular trading hours, you

1580
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,280
know, trailing stop losses getting

1581
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,440
stopped out. It is what it is. But that

1582
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,119
is a really, really nice run.

1583
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,839
carrying it over to electronic trading

1584
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,640
hours where you can see that there's

1585
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,200
trading beyond that three I'm sorry 4:14

1586
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,079
p.m. Eastern time. Uh this big drop off

1587
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,400
went right down into that there

1588
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,160
beautifully with just below the low. But

1589
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,640
look at that delivery.

1590
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,039
It's completely random. I'm sure most of

1591
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,280
your eyes

1592
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,760
I don't see it as that. See, I've seen

1593
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,640
these things happen a lot of times. Not

1594
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,400
just once in a lifetime like some of you

1595
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,559
20-year-olds. These things are measured.

1596
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,240
These things are scripted. These things

1597
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,520
are calculated. They're predetermined,

1598
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,440
predestined.

1599
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,920
And when you look at how smart money was

1600
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,480
selling above these highs here and above

1601
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,400
this candlestick's closing price here

1602
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,240
and here and above this candlestick's

1603
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,319
closing price here and here and above

1604
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:31,839
this candlestick's closing price here

1605
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,720
and here and then all of a sudden during

1606
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,880
a macro time inside of inversion fair

1607
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,559
value gap after three stages of smart

1608
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,119
money staging for shorts at all-time

1609
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,200
highs at the end of the week when the

1610
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,839
government shut down and all this stuff

1611
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:50,440
is coalesing at the same time

1612
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,319
Trump says, "I'm reinstating

1613
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:58,520
100% tariffs on China."

1614
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,000
There's the perfect excuse.

1615
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,079
There's a perfect excuse that buying and

1616
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,680
selling and random acts of chaos,

1617
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,280
nobody should expect to be able to time

1618
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,520
the market.

1619
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,400
It's a wonderful plot. that would make a

1620
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,600
wonderful TV movie.

1621
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,600
It takes that perspective to believe

1622
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,400
that fiction

1623
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,319
because that's what that is fiction.

1624
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,159
Now,

1625
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,600
am I going to sit here and tell you that

1626
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,839
it was expected on my part that it was

1627
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,799
going to deliver such a long drop down

1628
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,199
on Thursday? No.

1629
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:44,000
But submitting to the idea that I picked

1630
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,480
up from good old Larry Williams, the

1631
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,480
most money you make is holding for the

1632
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,359
close.

1633
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,480
Think about it. You're stuck in a car.

1634
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,920
You're limited to the perspective of

1635
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,600
your Samsung Ultra.

1636
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,679
So, you're not going to look at every

1637
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,359
single one minute candlestick. You're

1638
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,120
just going to hold an idea close to your

1639
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,719
heart and let time do its thing.

1640
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,120
And then you look and you're pleasantly

1641
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,120
surprised. Wow, it did what I expected

1642
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,520
to happen over next week.

1643
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,400
It did it all in one day.

1644
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:32,799
This should be signifying to you that if

1645
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:37,279
you're not respecting risk right now,

1646
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,199
if you think you're John Wayne of the

1647
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,719
markets,

1648
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,199
okay, you think you're the cool hand

1649
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,679
Luke,

1650
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,359
you think you're uh Paul Newman in the

1651
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,359
color of money and you just can't miss,

1652
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,960
you might want to take another look

1653
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,360
because there's a whole lot of things in

1654
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,040
the offing

1655
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,960
just past the horizon. You just can't

1656
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,400
see it yet, but it's coming.

1657
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,920
And it's going to make these markets

1658
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,360
move in a pace,

1659
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,360
in a method, and a style of delivery

1660
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,239
that's going to take your head clean off

1661
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,719
if you don't know what you're doing. You

1662
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,480
want to overlever your pretend little

1663
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,480
demo accounts that you affiliated with

1664
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,040
these funded account companies.

1665
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,120
Yeah, it's only the reset fees you got

1666
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,920
to pay

1667
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,239
that you're gambling

1668
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:38,480
and you're taking big lottery guesses.

1669
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,760
And if you're doing that with your real

1670
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,760
money,

1671
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,960
you are playing idiot poker.

1672
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,880
man. And you are holding a commode

1673
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,560
flush.

1674
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,480
You got you have no idea what's about to

1675
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,679
happen to you.

1676
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,480
There's so many things

1677
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,280
that can happen at any moment at the

1678
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,840
drop of a hat.

1679
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,120
Any one of those things are going to be

1680
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,719
the perfect instrument to justify why

1681
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,640
these markets don't stay where they're

1682
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,880
at and they leave at a pace that you've

1683
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,280
never seen before.

1684
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,080
And if you're caught on the wrong side,

1685
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,560
Lord help you.

1686
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,280
So you have to be careful.

1687
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,000
You have to be careful. And overnight

1688
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,600
gap risk should be your number one

1689
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,960
priority.

1690
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,159
not assuming it.

1691
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,440
Don't hold overnight.

1692
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,960
If you're a trader and you're doing

1693
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,760
anything holding overnight,

1694
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,960
Yeah.

1695
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,719
Well, you know, good luck.

1696
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,679
Cuz if you're on the wrong side,

1697
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:04,000
no, that's not where I want to be at.

1698
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,120
Because if it can move this much in one

1699
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,120
day,

1700
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,280
how much do you think it can do

1701
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,600
overnight when we open up on Sunday? How

1702
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,600
much can it move just from where we

1703
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,840
close on Friday, 5:00 p.m. Eastern time

1704
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,320
and opening up on 6:00, 1 hour later?

1705
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,120
What prevents them from opening up 1,500

1706
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,960
handles different from where you last

1707
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,800
saw it?

1708
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,880
Nothing.

1709
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,199
That's the thing you don't understand.

1710
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,239
Like you think that there's got to be,

1711
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,600
you know, a a a method that prevents

1712
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,120
things like that. It it this isn't like

1713
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,400
that. Remember,

1714
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,239
you think smart money is not short right

1715
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,320
now.

1716
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,320
Look where they've moved it. They are

1717
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,120
not letting other people in on that

1718
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,880
move.

1719
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,880
They've already shifted this thing a

1720
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,880
lot.

1721
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,760
Now, what do you think the public wants

1722
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,040
to do? Come Monday or Well, Monday's a

1723
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,040
holiday. When they can get in the market

1724
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,199
and trade

1725
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,280
they're going to do what? If they're

1726
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,440
long, they're going to be scared and

1727
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,320
they're going to try to get out.

1728
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,000
And people that don't know how to trade

1729
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,679
see it as, wow, it's probably going to

1730
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,159
start dropping now.

1731
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,520
You should not be trying to do anything

1732
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,000
right now. It's already moved a lot. So,

1733
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,400
just sit still. Wait for the dust to

1734
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,679
settle a little bit. And if it keeps

1735
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,840
going lower and you miss it, that's

1736
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,880
better than trying to chase it.

1737
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,440
That's it for this one, folks. Until

1738
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,320
talk to you next week, Lord willing.

1739
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,920
Enjoy your weekend. Be safe and good

1740
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,960
luck and good trading.
