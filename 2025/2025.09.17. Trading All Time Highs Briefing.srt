1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,639
Hello folks, how are you? I hope you're

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,040
doing well. So, tonight obviously is

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,160
September 16th, 2025

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,360
and some of you

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,120
got a little upset with me, didn't you?

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,359
Last night was a lesson on patience.

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,439
Now, I've done it in the past, but I

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,039
promise I won't pull any shenanigans

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,039
past that. But I wanted to show you how

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
in this industry it's very important

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,439
that you try to refrain from building a

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,239
lot of anticipation expectation of doing

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,000
something right away. And by priming you

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,640
about a specific time, a very specific

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,160
date in advance, it got you excited much

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,079
like when you learn something new from

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,280
me. Tonight we'll go over some things

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,840
and I don't want you to run right out

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
there tomorrow and try to apply all this

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
and try to risk real money. That's the

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,399
the last thing I want you to do. What I

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719
want you to do is build a library of

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,400
information.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,720
Now I'm going to be making available all

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
the lecture notes each time I do it and

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
it'll be shared in the telegram channel

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
and you can find the link in the last

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,840
page of the the presentation tonight.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
It'll be in the lecture notes. Also, the

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,680
hyperlink, you can go to my YouTube

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
channel. Click on the description of my

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,360
YouTube channel and scrub down to where

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,200
it gives you the link to Twitter and my

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,840
personal website. And at the bottom,

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,000
you'll see the official Telegram channel

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
link. Okay? There's a lot of fakes out

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
there pretending to be me right now and

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
doing a lot of scams, offering fake

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,799
investment

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,720
opportunities and crypto this and crypto

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,439
that and or automated trading. I don't

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,840
do any of those things, okay? Uh I'm not

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
trying to hawk or sell anything to you

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
in the Telegram channel and I'm never

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,640
going to DM you in Telegram. If you DM

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,159
me, I'm going to ignore you. Okay? So,

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
tonight I'm going to be talking about

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,800
the principle of trading all-time market

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,039
highs.

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,800
Now, admittedly, this is something that

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
I had uh struggled with when I was a

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
younger trader uh because I wanted to

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
pick the tops.

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,239
I figured the richest people in the

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
world traded like that. So, I was trying

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
to find that elusive recipe, if you

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,400
will, and it doesn't exist. Okay? I can

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
promise you that there is no one out

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440
there that's going to be able to tell

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
you when a when a bull market is

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
complete, especially when it's trading

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
at all-time highs. It's a guess, okay?

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,800
And if there was a science to that, um,

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,120
I probably would be the person to know

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,080
how to do it, but I don't believe it's

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,720
possible. Okay? And the reason why is uh

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,080
you don't know how far they're going to

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
go with it. And they keep pressing the

69
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,200
boundaries of discovery on what the

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
extreme can be. Each day it'll make a

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,680
new higher high. And the worst thing I

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,879
had to discover was I missed a lot of

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,640
really good buying opportunities in the

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,120
past. So learning this skill set tonight

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,080
isn't going to be a oneandone. You learn

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
everything by watching this video. But

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,959
I'm going to give you a lot of

78
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
principles that

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,480
at least helped me and helped a lot of

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
my students over the decades of me

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,480
teaching. So, let's get on with it.

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,519
All right. Trading all-time highs in any

83
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,159
market. Now, I have that slightly

84
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,040
different in in the wording because I

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
want you to understand that while I'm

86
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,000
talking about this tonight over a NASDAQ

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
chart, I know some of you that are all

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
Forex only and you're already thinking,

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,439
I'm never going to talk about Forex. I

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,200
am going to talk about Forex. Everything

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,879
I'm talking about tonight is applicable

92
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,760
to Forex and futures and any other

93
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,560
market. Okay? So

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
when we get into the analysis, which

95
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,239
won't start until 2 weeks from now.

96
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,480
Okay? So I told you there'd be 10

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
fundamental and foundational studies and

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
lectures. So there'll be one this

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,199
Saturday. There won't be any on Saturday

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,960
and Sunday normally. So this week, just

101
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,639
because I gave you a little teaser last

102
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,320
night and just to see who would complain

103
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,560
so I could block them on my social media

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
accounts. I don't want to see

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
complainers. The idea is that we're

106
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
going to teach the principles that I

107
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,840
want to cover. They're topical studies.

108
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
Okay? So, I'm not teaching a model. I've

109
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,759
already taught enough models. I'm

110
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
teaching topical studies that will help

111
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
enhance the likelihood that you'll find

112
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,759
success with what I already taught.

113
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,320
Okay? So, it's not that I'm trying to

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,919
reinvent the wheel or give you something

115
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,680
new and shiny. I'm trying to build and

116
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,240
beef up your present understanding.

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
Okay? So that's really primarily what

118
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
we're doing over the next couple months

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
until we get into the second week of

120
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
November and then I'll go on to my

121
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,919
traditional holiday break. All right. So

122
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,120
trading all-time highs in any market.

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,639
When a market is trading at all-time

124
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
highs, it is more likely that it will

125
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,199
continue to post higher all-time highs.

126
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,039
Key reference points in algorithmic

127
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,199
price delivery.

128
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,120
Look for price to trade under down close

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
candles. closing prices. These are

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,960
rejection blocks and they tend to

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,360
promote new runs higher in price.

132
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,080
If possible, look for all buy side and

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
balance sellside in efficiency fair

134
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,720
value gaps to offer redelivery prior to

135
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,000
new legs higher in price.

136
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,440
Grade all premium candle wicks and

137
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,360
anticipate the gradient levels to offer

138
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,639
discount sensitivity in price.

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,479
Look through upclose candles and refer

140
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
to the premium candle wicks. They need

141
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,880
not be isolated. And I'll cover what

142
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,240
that means in a few moments.

143
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,120
Look for price to trade under up close

144
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
candles closing prices. Near all-time

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,479
highs, markets tend to overshoot

146
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,800
previous close redely in the form of

147
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,000
bear traps.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
Immediate rebalance is typically very

149
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,880
strong and is likely to offer discount

150
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,360
sensitivity.

151
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Avoid

152
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,680
predicting the reversal high. In other

153
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
words, simply stay bullish until the

154
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,600
market proves to you that it's

155
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,199
completely and utterly broke down and

156
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,000
reversed. Now, that might sound scary.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
What happens if I get into a trade,

158
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
Michael, and I'm long and the market

159
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,720
completely collapses and hurts me and I

160
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,080
lose money? That's part of this. You

161
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
can't go through this industry and have

162
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
a career where you never have anything

163
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
bad happen to you. That's unfortunate

164
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,080
because

165
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,840
everyone comes into this industry like I

166
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,759
did too and we think that we're going to

167
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,039
be the exception. We're not going to

168
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,360
find that very painful outcome. And if

169
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,479
you're going to be trading markets that

170
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,080
are trading at all-time highs, you

171
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,160
either let the market go without you and

172
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,199
trade something else or you submit to

173
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,720
the idea that you want to keep taking

174
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
buy signals

175
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,160
and let money management and good trade

176
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,479
management do its job. If you're not

177
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,800
overleveraging, if you're not over

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,520
well overtrading,

179
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
pushing the boundaries of what you're

180
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
really capable of weathering as a trader

181
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
in terms of a loss, as long as you're

182
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
not doing that, it won't take you out of

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
the game. If you're fearful that it's

184
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
going to take you out of the game on any

185
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
one particular trade or one market

186
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,400
condition setup, then you're probably

187
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,360
over overleveraging and you're doing too

188
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
much where the outcome of one single

189
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
transaction will completely undermine

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,479
you. And no trader should ever have

191
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
their leverage or gearing on their

192
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,520
trades that high.

193
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,800
All right, so we're going to take a look

194
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,919
at the chart here on the lefth hand

195
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,039
side. And this is a daily chart. So

196
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:15,840
we're not going to look at anything

197
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,479
below a daily chart. So everything here

198
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,039
is germanine to bias. It's germanine to

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
narrative. How that's going to blend

200
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,960
together and incorporate the idea and

201
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,879
the aspects of all-time highs. Now this

202
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
high here

203
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,719
is the all-time high prior to the run

204
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,719
higher that we've seen trading up to

205
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
24,43

206
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,320
and a half.

207
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,959
So we're going to be looking at the

208
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
central tenants I've covered here on the

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,440
right in a list throughout the price

210
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,720
action shown on the daily chart. So

211
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,600
first we see that there is a sellside

212
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,040
liquidity pool raid here. So that run

213
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,600
rate right below that low it's taken the

214
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,160
sellside liquidity here and then now

215
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,839
it's going to start to gravitate back to

216
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,560
this high here. Now before it gets there

217
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,399
we have this short-term high. So, this

218
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,240
is going to be the highest probability

219
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
high it's going to trade to, but keeping

220
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
with the rules, when we're trading near

221
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,000
all-time highs, it's likely to continue

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
to make higher highs, higher all-time

223
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,440
highs. So, we would anticipate this high

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
being taken out should it trade to it.

225
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,160
But working from this low here, we'll

226
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
start annotating everything. So, we have

227
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,279
an up close candle here. the closing

228
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,959
price of that candle.

229
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,040
Notice the next candle we open and we

230
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
trade down below it. So trading below

231
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,240
that previous day's close, if there was

232
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
a

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,959
opening range gap, for instance,

234
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
many times when we're trading at

235
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
all-time highs or near all-time highs,

236
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,519
trading right back to the previous day's

237
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,680
close, it can overshoot it. And the

238
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,040
reason why it does that is because

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
there's a lot of people in this industry

240
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,040
that understands the gap that forms from

241
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
the previous day's close and where we

242
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,200
open at 9:30 in the morning or whatever

243
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,440
the uh the market opening price would

244
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,800
be. That gap in efficiency gaps tend to

245
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,760
rebalance trade back to them offer both

246
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,839
buy side and sell side delivery in that

247
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,720
gap and then price goes in the direction

248
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
of the gap. But when we're trading near

249
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
all-time highs, it tends to create these

250
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,279
little bear traps where it doesn't just

251
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,880
simply go back to the previous day's

252
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,320
close, it goes beyond that and trades

253
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,560
lower. What do you think the mindset is

254
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
of the traders that sees that? They're

255
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,640
going to think, "Wow, it's gone beyond

256
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
just simply going back and closing any

257
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,440
opening range gap. It's broke down and

258
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
traded below the opening range gap and

259
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,519
went lower." So, they're going to think

260
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,279
what? The market's going to keep going

261
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,959
lower. and they're going to think that

262
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,519
the market is now topped. And that's

263
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,040
what the market makers tend to do in

264
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,240
this general market condition. These are

265
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,560
just very generic principles that I live

266
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,360
by as a trader. And if you incorporate

267
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
them, you you're not going to be

268
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
completely exempt from having anything

269
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
bad happen to you. It doesn't mean

270
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,519
you're not going to have losing trades

271
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,200
or do it wrong. It just means that at

272
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
least you won't be guessing like

273
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,839
everyone else does because most every

274
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,240
other individual out there, they're all

275
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
going to try to pick the top. They're

276
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,440
all expecting a crash. They're all

277
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,000
trying to get the next big, you know,

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,200
slide in price lower. And what I'm going

279
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,519
to do is press on you to to think about

280
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,200
how they're going to just keep taking it

281
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
higher.

282
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,079
So, this is what I mean by overshooting

283
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,480
below the previous day's close right

284
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
here. Next day we open and we trade down

285
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,839
below that close. And traders that are

286
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,640
looking for a collapse in price, they

287
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,240
may even look at this as relative equal

288
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
lows that the market may want to trade

289
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
down there and take that out. Try to

290
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,880
avoid that. Okay. And the next example

291
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,320
here is immediate rebalance. This market

292
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,320
creates a a nice big up close candle. We

293
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
open here. We trade back down to the

294
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
previous day's close. So what are they

295
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
going to do? They're going to overshoot

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
that. and it does it trades all the way

297
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,279
back down to the day before this up

298
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
close candle to offer an immediate

299
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
rebalance.

300
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,920
So, two principles there are happening.

301
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
We're opening trading back to the

302
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
previous stage close, but not just

303
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
closing that gap and then going higher.

304
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,880
It's closing that gap and going all the

305
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,519
way back over top and redelivery back to

306
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,760
this candle's high. That's immediate

307
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
rebalance. When that happens, generally,

308
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,399
you're going to see a very, very strong

309
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,600
reaction. And there's going to be a lot

310
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
of discount sensitivity, meaning that

311
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,519
the market's going to treat that as a

312
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,839
very strong discount PD array, and the

313
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,399
market's going to immediately launch

314
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
higher from there. And you can see that

315
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,560
actually happens here. And then the next

316
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,720
day, we open below the previous day's

317
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
close, which is another tenant where we

318
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,959
open, we trade down below the previous

319
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,839
day's close. That's a rejection block.

320
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,440
That closing price here on a down close

321
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,079
candle and it's going to be rejected as

322
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,760
you can see here. Comes right back up.

323
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
But notice it doesn't take out that that

324
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,160
candle's high. The next day we open, we

325
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
got a small little gap there. So what's

326
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,440
going to happen? It's going to it's

327
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,079
going to probe. Okay? It's going to go

328
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,000
below just

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,519
closing that gap is what everybody's

330
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
expecting, but it's going to go below

331
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,079
that previous day's close and entice

332
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,639
traders to do what? Be short.

333
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,480
So we have that rejection block discount

334
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,040
sensitivity on this candle

335
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
and now we have this premium candle wick

336
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,839
and we're grading that. So we have the

337
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,639
lower quadrant consequent encroachment

338
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
upper quadrant and we don't need the

339
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
high and the low annotated. We're going

340
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
to look at the chart to see what that

341
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
is. But not notice the sensitivity here

342
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,839
at the 75 quadrant. we open, reach the

343
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,920
previous day's close. So, everyone that

344
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
wants to see just simply the gap closure

345
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,199
and then continue higher, they're

346
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,839
getting toasted here. Trades down to

347
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,519
that lower quadrant, overshoots it a

348
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,839
little bit and then sends it higher,

349
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,480
taking out the previous two days high.

350
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,720
Then the next day,

351
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,760
we have a higher open. We trade down to

352
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,959
the previous day's close. Again, that

353
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,279
gap is a trap to set for bears. it drops

354
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
lower down to the 50% level of that

355
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,320
premium candle wick. Again, we cut

356
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,199
through these candles, all these premium

357
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,079
candle wicks, keep them annotated

358
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,279
because the market's going to go back

359
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,120
into those levels again. When it

360
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,040
overshoots the previous day's closing

361
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,680
price, it's going to trap traders simply

362
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,079
looking for the gap closure and then

363
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,040
buying. It's it's going to go lower. It

364
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,639
does this a lot. And I'm not expecting

365
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,240
you to just simply use this because it

366
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
looks like I'm cherry-picking. go back

367
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,240
over old market data. Look at stocks.

368
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Stocks are really good with this. So, if

369
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,440
you're a trader that wants to trade um

370
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
you know,

371
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,279
MISC stocks or NASDAQ stocks, uh this is

372
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,800
a principle that repeats a lot with them

373
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,720
as well. The the gaps tend to be a

374
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,959
little bit larger there, too. So, it

375
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,639
gives you a lot of volatility if you're

376
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,440
if you're trying to day trade those um

377
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,959
assets. I don't like the day trade

378
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,600
stocks, but I just toss it out there for

379
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,959
no extra charge. But we see the premium

380
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,600
candle wick gradient discount

381
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,639
sensitivity here on this candle. We

382
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,320
open. We have a volume imbalance.

383
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,720
We trade down to this premium candle

384
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
wick and it's halfway point is the

385
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,399
consequent encroachment. And notice how

386
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,240
it trades right down to that. So, not

387
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
only do we open here, we go back to the

388
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,880
previous day's closing price. Most

389
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,240
traders that are watching this on a day

390
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,360
trading basis, they're going to see that

391
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,639
and think, "Okay, well, it's gap

392
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,920
closure. Now, it's going to rally

393
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,759
because it's bullish." And the market

394
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,360
just goes even lower. But goes right

395
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,279
back to where I teach you to watch these

396
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,480
premium candle wicks. The consequent

397
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,199
encroachment hits it there beautifully

398
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,920
and then trades higher. And the next day

399
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,160
we open, come back to the previous day's

400
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,759
close, overshoot it again to the

401
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
downside, suckering in people thinking

402
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,360
it's it's created a top. It has to have

403
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,440
created a top and they get short and

404
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
then market runs right over top of them

405
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,560
again,

406
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,360
reaching the all-time high as we

407
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
indicated a little bit ago.

408
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
So I want you to think about how using

409
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,680
these principles, these very

410
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,959
generic ideas that it's not complicated.

411
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,800
They keep repeating and it keeps you on

412
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,240
the on your toes about anticipating some

413
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,720
measure of manipulation. So, this is

414
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,880
what generally the retail traders get

415
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
caught up in because they're chasing

416
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,439
price, anticipating, hoping, and and

417
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,439
praying basically that the market's

418
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,280
going to break down and collapse. But

419
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,760
all the market does is go back to these

420
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,319
previous PDA rays algorithmically and

421
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,799
then delivers and spools higher. And

422
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,319
it's very frustrating if you don't know

423
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,559
these things. Maybe you've been hurt.

424
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,160
Maybe you've been trying to capture the

425
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,919
the high in this market or another

426
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
market. And you can go back and look at

427
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,919
your trades and you can pretty much see

428
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,080
that what you failed on is what I'm

429
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
showing how you can avoid doing that in

430
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,000
the future. And I'm not saying you're

431
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,679
not going to take losing trades. I'm

432
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,880
saying that at least you're going to

433
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
know now how the market's algorithm

434
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,679
reprices back into these very specific

435
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
PDAs when they're trading at all-time

436
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,360
highs or near all-time highs. Until the

437
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,880
market completely collapses and shows

438
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
you it's reversed,

439
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,120
don't look for shorts. It's better for

440
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,559
you to anticipate it like this because

441
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,919
you'll get the lines portion of the

442
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,080
move. You'll be on side. You'll be

443
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,000
within the narrative. You'll be with the

444
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,320
bias correctly. Higher time frame order

445
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,799
flow is on your in your favor. And

446
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,120
you'll be able to weather the daily

447
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,000
range eb and flow up and down and get

448
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,120
the lion's portion of the move.

449
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
Hope you found this insightful. Thank

450
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
you for your continued interest. Until

451
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,320
next time, I wish you good luck and good

452
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,320
trading.
