1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello folks, welcome back. Today is

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,359
September 17th, 2025.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, and tonight's lecture is going to

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,080
be on trading FOMC two-stage delivery.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,680
All right, so we're looking at the

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,400
NASDAQ. uh we rolled over to December

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,640
contract. In case you haven't noticed,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
the the volume open interest has

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,480
increased to the degree that December is

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,079
now higher and more active.

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,360
All right. So, we're looking at on the

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,520
left hand side, it's the daily chart for

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,960
December contract of NASDAQ futures

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,600
here. And then over here, we have a one

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
minute candlestick chart for the same.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,640
Okay. And this handsome devil here, he's

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,680
got his eye on you. Okay.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,680
So, um, for the folks that may want to

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,199
ask, no, I'm not going to remove that

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,559
because it's simply a matter of piracy.

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,640
Uh, people take my stuff and pretend

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
it's theirs. So, this way, there's only

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
one of me. Okay. So, the

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119
the concepts I went over last night as

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,000
it regards to

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,479
trading all-time highs or or near

27
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
all-time highs is to constantly look at

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,080
very specific price points,

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,119
volume balance, fair value gaps,

30
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,240
the opens,

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,079
closes,

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,400
and try to avoid trying to pick the top.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
Now, it doesn't mean that once you're

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,439
seasoned as a analyst that you can't

35
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,960
look for shorts, but they have to be

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,560
intraday, but the larger scale price

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,320
runs

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
are going to be more apt to be in line

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
with going higher because, you know,

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,880
it's impossible to pick the top. Okay?

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
And anyone that tells you that they

42
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,000
figured it out, they're lying. All

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,920
right? So by looking at

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,280
the intraday chart here,

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
notice that this high and this high are

46
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,120
relatively equal.

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,319
And if you go back to the left a little

48
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,640
bit more over here as well. And I'll

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
counsel you to look at the open and

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,520
close of yesterday's candle on the daily

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
chart. Mark that out and you'll see that

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,520
that's very close to running out these

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,920
relatively highs. And that's what we

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,120
have here at 9:30. We have a run up and

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,360
it breaks lower. So we have a shift in

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
market structure. And this is enough to

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,680
indicate a shift in market structure

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
bearishly.

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,840
And then another swing low here. Then we

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,680
have relative equal lows which we'll

61
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,760
look at as minor sellside. And then we

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
have a sellside liquidity pool here.

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,640
Now,

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,239
I'm going to show you by looking at

65
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,720
where this sellside liquidity pool is in

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,720
reference to this range here, this

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
single up close candle on Monday. So,

68
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,480
we're going to look at where this is in

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,040
proximity to this range between this

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,680
candlesticks low, this candlesticks

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,000
high,

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,640
and why it's more likely to come back

73
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
down into this volume imbalance. and

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,599
this fair value. Now, before I get any

75
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,799
further, uh I did some trades today and

76
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,519
I shorted in the morning here. I'll go

77
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,440
over this and then I

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,519
ordered once more in the afternoon at

79
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,040
the FOMC just using the model 2022. So,

80
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,599
it's not complicated. It's not Goldbach.

81
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
I now have a student of mine that just

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,519
insists that that's what it is and he's

83
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,799
convinced other people that's what it

84
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,040
is. I swear to you in Jesus name, it's

85
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,280
not Goldbach. Okay? So, um if if you

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
want to believe I'm I'm telling you

87
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,879
something that's not true, then then run

88
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,200
with it. Okay? But I I'm honestly

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
telling you what I'm doing and what I

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,400
teach and what I trade with has

91
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
absolutely nothing to do with Gold Buck

92
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
and no, it's not Enigma. Okay? So buy

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
side liquidity pool here. We run up at

94
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,560
9:30 opening and then we break lower and

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,639
then you know the drill for 2022's

96
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,960
model. We run the fib from the high to

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
low. We look for it to trade to a

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
premium. That means it's got to go above

99
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
50%. Ideally, you can see a convergence

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
with the standard flagship pattern of my

101
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
channel, which was for a long time the

102
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
optimal trade entry, which is simply

103
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,000
just a 3/4 pullback in a impulsive price

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,080
leg like this, and then running up

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,639
higher into this small little

106
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,240
inefficiency right there. So, we're

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
going to look at a lot of these things

108
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
in a moment in greater detail, but for

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,600
now, uh, let's start fleshing out this

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
lower time frame in relationship to that

111
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
daily chart as well.

112
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
So here's the buy side liquidity pool

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,240
and here is the buy side imbalance

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,919
sellside side and efficiency bissy which

115
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
is a bullish fair value gap. Uh so we

116
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,280
always want to grade that price swing

117
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,080
but keep your eye on this candlesticks

118
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,680
low right here. I had that noted with

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,919
that short little trend line. That is

120
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,000
this line right here. So that way we

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
don't lose track of where we're at. And

122
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
then this line right here on the daily

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
chart is this level down here. So there

124
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,840
are three blue lines on the one minute

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,240
chart but it's only two on the daily. So

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
the upper one here is just simply the

127
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,680
buy side liquidity pool at 24,528

128
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,600
12. These lower two are in reference to

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,880
this buy side balance side efficiency.

130
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
All right. So we grade it. So the lower

131
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
quadrant consequent encroachment

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,400
midpoint upper quadrant

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
and then levels itself that being here's

134
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,520
the high of the daily bissy upper

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
quadrant

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,840
not quite encroachment midpoint lower

137
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,199
quadrant and the low

138
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,960
and then the southside liquidity pool

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,160
here and then the first presented fair

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
gap after 9:30

141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
a.m. Eastern time. So

142
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
that small little inefficiency. We'll

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,400
we'll zoom in in a moment. You can see

144
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
why I have it outlined as I have it

145
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
here. And then we have a smaller minor

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,120
side liquidity pool there. So running up

147
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,560
taking by side and then dropping down

148
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
southside liquidity pool here taken. And

149
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
then notice what they did. They took it

150
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,360
to this low and left that there. And

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,600
then it rallied back up. This is classic

152
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,680
model 2022.

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
When it leaves larger intermediate term

154
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,600
relative equal lows, this is a smaller

155
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,919
minor relative equal low in relationship

156
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,319
to that low and that low. So in other

157
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,400
words, it goes down then rallies back

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
up. This sellside liquidity pool here

159
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,280
with this low here is unfinished

160
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,880
business. Okay? Uh I'll have chapters um

161
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
in the three books coming that I'll

162
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,000
touch on each volume. I'll have more to

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
say about unfinished business, but the

164
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,280
idea is the market rallies up leaving

165
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,199
the sell side or sell stops here intact,

166
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,120
rallying up, which is a false hope rally

167
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,599
for bulls and it goes up into first

168
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,160
percent fair value gap and then sells

169
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
off and cares down through the sell

170
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,680
equity pool and goes right to consequent

171
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
encroachment of the daily buy side

172
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
efficiency. So, look at that price right

173
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,680
here in the green. 24,447

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
12.

175
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,039
That's what this is here. 24,447

176
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,759
1/2. It hits it right there. Then comes

177
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,160
right back up to the upper quadrant at

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,280
24,473 and a quarter and then hits it

179
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
dead on right there and sells off once

180
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,440
more. Goes lower to the lower quadrant.

181
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,800
these quadrants in my inefficiencies

182
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
that I place emphasis on from the higher

183
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
time frames down lower time frames. I

184
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,840
grade all of them and they're more

185
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,879
sensitive. They're more accurate than

186
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,280
things like common floor pivots. Um you

187
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
simple support and resistance ideas

188
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
which is absolutely you know left to the

189
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
device of the user. It's so subjective.

190
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,320
is absolutely ridiculous to consider

191
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,640
that while the idea of support and

192
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,560
resistance

193
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,159
is beneficial for someone that's brand

194
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
new because you know you want to see how

195
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
prices bounce at specific levels and and

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
reject at specific levels above it

197
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
but it's not as easy as simply saying

198
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,399
well it's this high and that low because

199
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
soon as you try to use it and try to

200
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,760
think like that and the market's just

201
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
going to go right on through it so

202
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,040
that's why I've created these concepts

203
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,600
where it's very very specific because it

204
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
gets in sync with the algorithm that

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
doesn't exist. Right?

206
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
So, we're going to move the chart over a

207
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
little bit in time. And you can clearly

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
see now here, see that little volume

209
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,720
imbalance right there?

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
Separation between those candlesticks

211
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,200
open and that candlesticks

212
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
close.

213
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
Then we have a smaller volume and bounce

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,920
there as well. And that's why I'm not

215
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,519
using this little segment right here,

216
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
which you probably saw in your chart

217
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,959
thinking that that might be it. But you

218
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,480
always have to include the volume

219
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
imbalance because the algorithm is going

220
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,240
to refer to that as well. So the market

221
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,399
drops down, sweeps into these

222
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,519
corion of the daily bi here, and then

223
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
rise back up, hits a dead bang on the

224
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
upper quadrant. That's this line right

225
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,839
here. So what we're looking at was

226
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,680
looking at it going down to this level

227
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
here and all the move from that point

228
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,600
down here. So in other words, from this

229
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
green line down to this low, this hasn't

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,600
happened yet right here. So we hit the

231
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
upper quadrant, we break down the

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,880
consequent encroachment, break lower,

233
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,399
come back to consequent encroachment as

234
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,000
resistance.

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,959
So this is a premium sensitivity

236
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,200
drops lower, lower quadrant,

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
lower and then comes back up. Now

238
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,320
failure at consequent encroachment

239
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
breaks lower premium sensitivity premium

240
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,519
sensitivity at 24,421 a2 and then

241
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,320
finally we get up to

242
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
or down to rather this candlestick's

243
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,920
high here.

244
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,040
So that's this level that blue line is

245
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,120
this blue line here indicating that that

246
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,240
high right there. So last Friday's high

247
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
from this high down to that low running

248
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,600
a fib on it. What I'm highlighting here

249
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,760
is the 79% and 62% retracement level. So

250
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
this is optimal trade entry here and it

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
overlaps. Look at our body stop inside

252
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
of the first percent of fair value gap.

253
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,560
But it's also halfway point 70.5.

254
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
that little sweet spot I taught when the

255
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,800
optimal trade entry hits that and breaks

256
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,519
lower. Comes right back up into a small

257
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,800
little gap right here. We'll look at

258
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
that in a minute.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,160
Trades right up into it there. Slams

260
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,079
into it. And it also keep cutting

261
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,279
through. Look at that. You see that?

262
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,279
That's beautiful. This

263
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,640
is venom. So we have a convergence of

264
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,760
fair value gap and venom because we have

265
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,600
this pass through on the upside. This

266
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
pass through on the downside. So it can

267
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,399
appear just like that and it isolates

268
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,399
all this price action right here. So it

269
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,360
hits it and then moves lower. Nice

270
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,279
little sellside bounce by efficiency

271
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,200
here. Comes right back up, hits the

272
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
consequent encroachment, sells off and

273
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,920
then hits the low of that inefficiency.

274
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
That in and of itself is enough for the

275
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,560
morning session. You can hold for lower,

276
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,440
but it's FOMC day. So, you want to be

277
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,120
very surgical about what you're looking

278
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,320
for. Get in, get out.

279
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
So, you can see the premium sensitivity

280
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,079
as indicated here. And it went much more

281
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,120
lower than that of the sellside

282
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,560
liquidity pools that we highlighted on

283
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
just the one minute chart. So, it's

284
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
important by having the levels that's

285
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
indicated as I taught last night in

286
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,760
lecture trading with all-time highs or

287
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
around all-time highs. Uh, it's really

288
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,639
important that you take your

289
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,519
inefficiencies and you grade them and

290
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,079
transpose those levels onto your lower

291
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,760
time frames and you you'll start to see

292
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,680
setups that were just always there, but

293
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,880
you never noticed them before.

294
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,959
All right. So now I highlighted this

295
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,120
level here purple. You can see it's now

296
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,959
discount sensitivity and that's what

297
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
this is here. So this purple line is

298
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,040
this purple line here. So that way we

299
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
can track it.

300
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,440
And now I'm zoomed in on the daily chart

301
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,880
over here so we can see a little bit

302
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,279
more detail.

303
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,360
And right down here, this is a volume

304
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
imbalance. And if you watch the the

305
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
trade example I did today, because I was

306
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
watching it and I was keyed up about the

307
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,320
the FOMC announcement activity and the

308
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,120
volatility that was created, I miscalled

309
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,360
this as a as a fair value gap and it's a

310
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,480
volume imbalance. That's what I was

311
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
referring to. This is a fair value gap,

312
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,959
but then this down here

313
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
is a volume of balance. So, it was

314
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,959
quicker and easier for me to say FVG in

315
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,760
the in the typing while the trade was

316
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,720
open. But, uh, to correct myself that

317
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,160
way. You're I know some of you are

318
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,399
probably thinking, uh, that's not that's

319
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,639
a it's a volume bounce. If that's what

320
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,800
you thought, you're correct. But, I'm

321
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm out there going, you know, live and

322
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
it's can't you just can't do everything

323
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
perfect. When you're trading, you're

324
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,279
concentrating on and it's doing FOMC and

325
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,240
you're trying to teach and you're trying

326
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,920
to type. It's a whole lot of stuff going

327
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
on. That's not It's not as easy as it

328
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
looks.

329
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
All right. So, and then we have this

330
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,920
premium wick. I graded that. So, when

331
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,360
you see these levels over here, uh this

332
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,320
that level right there, 24,384.75,

333
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,279
that's this level right here. So, it's

334
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,839
the upper quadrant of this premium wick.

335
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,760
A premium wick is any wick above a

336
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,959
candle. And this is a discount wick. any

337
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,959
wick that's below the candlestick body.

338
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,880
Okay, so put that in your notes.

339
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,720
And now I am grading the

340
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,120
fair value gap here but including the

341
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,839
volume of balance to that low. Okay. And

342
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,120
you can't see those levels here because

343
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,079
it's below.

344
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,920
Now scrubbing over more into the day now

345
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,320
the PM session.

346
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,079
We can see the sensitivity around that

347
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,320
24,384.75

348
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
level, which is this one here. So, at

349
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,320
this moment, price has done at 12:45.

350
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
It's trading right in here.

351
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
And just I'm sorry, right here. It's

352
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,800
trading right here.

353
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,760
And it's just fallen

354
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,600
just above the consequent encouragement

355
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,120
level right there. And again, this

356
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,160
portion of the day had not been

357
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,680
delivered yet. So, we're right about

358
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,560
here at 12:45. Then we come back up. We

359
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,440
find discount sensitivity here at the

360
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
upper quadrant there. Now, it's going to

361
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,480
trade back up to this level here, that

362
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,320
blue line. That's this blue line right

363
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,240
here.

364
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
And it's easy to track it by saying

365
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,959
24,400 24,390.

366
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,480
24400

367
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
and then 390 is between these two

368
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,000
prices. So that's what this blue line is

369
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,839
here. So that's how you want to be

370
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,759
navigating. And when you're when you're

371
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,839
journaling, I'm actually doing the

372
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,839
charting

373
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,160
all the annotations for you. That that's

374
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,800
the benefit of this this little suare

375
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,320
together. You know, going into the

376
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
holidays,

377
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,959
you're encouraged to print the PDF out

378
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
or type over them with your additional

379
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
annotations, things that are pertinent

380
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,839
to you. So I leave lots of empty space.

381
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,440
That's why I've been doing it this way

382
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
because it gives you room to type in

383
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
here or write by hand. All this area

384
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,240
over here, you can write in there and

385
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,399
draw special attention to things that I

386
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,839
may not have drawn that much attention

387
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,920
to, but you have seen it and it means

388
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,959
something to you.

389
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,040
All right. And then the 2:00 hour, I've

390
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,199
delineated that. And I've extended the

391
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,920
first percent of your value gap here

392
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,000
into the afternoon. It's something I

393
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
teach.

394
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,240
And 2 o'clock is now here.

395
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,600
Price trades up into the first present

396
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,679
fair value gap post 2 p.m. So the market

397
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,240
breaks lower. We have a fair value gap

398
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,120
that's formed here. We trade down into

399
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,640
the upper quadrant of the fair value gap

400
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,520
here between this candlesticks close.

401
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,480
And this candle sticks

402
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,160
below

403
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,400
that quadrant, upper quadrant level at

404
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
24,297

405
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
3/4. That's this level right here. It

406
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
trades down to it there and then rallies

407
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,679
all the way back up to this little gap

408
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,799
right there. So again, all this is is

409
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,200
high to low, 3/4 pullback, optimal trade

410
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
entry,

411
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
fair value gap, model 2022,

412
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,400
unfinished business, and then unfinished

413
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,679
business down here in the volume

414
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,720
imbalance. So

415
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,840
the market trade up here. You watch me

416
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
get stopped out on that run in here and

417
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,360
then it breaks lower and finally gets

418
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
into the volume imbalance. You can find

419
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
that little snippet, the little vignette

420
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,480
of the trade on my X account on what

421
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,799
used to be called Twitter. It's sped up.

422
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,960
This is a small little piece of it, but

423
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
you actually see me not get my objective

424
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,320
and I end up getting stopped out. I

425
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
trail a stop loss. But you know in all

426
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,880
this price action here I thought that we

427
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,200
had enough to protect the short but it

428
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,799
came back up snagged and then went down

429
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
and got it here and rallies up

430
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,720
sensitivity here on that same level

431
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
there. So once it dropped down the

432
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,679
volume and balance on the daily chart

433
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
here

434
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,200
there's

435
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,840
going to do the second stage of delivery

436
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,480
of of FOMC. And I'll show you in a

437
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,440
second what that means. But here's 230.

438
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,600
Usually there's a another wave of price

439
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,679
action that begins at 230 and whatever

440
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
the high or the low is, usually it'll

441
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,640
run for it. But it first dropped down

442
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,200
sticking true to form and the things I

443
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,360
talked about last night. It went down to

444
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,919
a se severe deep deep discount into that

445
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,840
volume imbalance and then rallied all

446
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
the way back up. straight shot. No

447
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,880
pullbacks.

448
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,000
High high relative equal comes back

449
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
down.

450
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,520
Lower quadrant

451
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,960
that's here of this fair value gap.

452
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,080
And you're going to want to watch this

453
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,840
video a few times and also look at the

454
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,720
charts in your own platform and compare

455
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,640
and contrast and you'll see what it's

456
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,280
doing here. But if you don't have your

457
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
your journal with multiple time frames

458
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,360
like this at minimum, you know what the

459
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,280
daily charts doing and your trading time

460
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,240
frame, you're not going to see what it

461
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
is that you're trying to learn.

462
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,760
You're you're obscuring your ability to

463
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
follow along with price action. But it

464
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
then rallies up

465
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
consequent encouragement

466
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,720
upper quadrant and then sends it through

467
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
first percent gap and the relative equal

468
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,240
highs here. So that initial intraday

469
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,840
daily high here earlier in the day they

470
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,000
take that out and then we start to

471
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,160
consolidate in between the quadrant

472
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,000
levels and first present the fair value

473
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,320
gap.

474
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
This is the first stage delivery where

475
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,080
it sells off at 2 p.m. beginning of FOMC

476
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,159
and then during the conference portion

477
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,919
and pal tends to be a little bit like

478
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,720
me. He likes to talk more than most

479
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,559
people want to listen to. So it kind of

480
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,640
like delays it a little bit. And then

481
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,200
here we have it there and then all the

482
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,000
way back up there picking out the buy

483
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
side. And then the consolidation then

484
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,480
basically is untradeable.

485
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
And this is the second stage here from

486
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,880
the low up to the buy side running the

487
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,080
high of the day.

488
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,120
But look at this run here. That right

489
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,400
there. You wouldn't expect something

490
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,919
like that had you not listened to the

491
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,799
lecture I gave you last night.

492
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,360
And for all you FX4ex freaks out there,

493
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,840
this is the daily on dollar index. And

494
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
dollar admittedly has been basically

495
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,760
trash. Okay, it's unfortunate. You know,

496
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,159
it's it's waiting for its digital

497
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,000
version to be forced upon us. So, um,

498
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,080
what I've done here is I've watched the

499
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,240
low get taken out there and then we're

500
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
retracing back up into this

501
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,760
sell side of balance by side efficiency

502
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
volume of balance

503
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,400
and to that candlesticks

504
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
body. There's a small little separation

505
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,919
between here too. So, that's what I'm

506
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,679
showing here. and the market trades

507
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,559
right back up to consequent

508
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,240
encouragement of that inefficiency.

509
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Until we get above this and we ignore

510
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,320
the lower half of it and start building

511
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,880
PD arrays that are bullish,

512
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,080
I'm bearish on dollar until we do this

513
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,400
very thing here where we we use this as

514
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,120
constructive discount arrays and then

515
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,159
building new bullish

516
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,159
discount arrays that and shows price

517
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,840
respecting it and going higher and

518
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,000
starts tearing into these highs without

519
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,039
rejection. I'm staying bearish on

520
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,440
dollar. It can stay in a consolidation

521
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,400
still like it's been for months, but I'm

522
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
not bullish on dollar. Let's just say it

523
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,440
that way. But they took us all the way

524
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,039
down like this severely at 2:00 and then

525
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,600
basically nothing that was worthwhile

526
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
taking a trade on. I mean, I don't trade

527
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,640
the dollar index. It's used as a

528
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,520
barometer. It helps me determine the

529
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
opposite direction for euro and and

530
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,240
cable and any other dollar pair cross.

531
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,360
And here's a euro and you go out to a

532
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,039
weekly chart. And I I want to say I

533
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,360
talked about these levels here when I

534
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,520
was talking about euro, but I can't

535
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
remember admittedly if I was talking to

536
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
my private students or if it was

537
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,919
something I said in a video or something

538
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,880
I'd done on X. But I know I talked about

539
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,960
these two relative equal highs here and

540
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,600
I I simply just don't remember where I

541
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
set it. So, um I'm I just wanted to put

542
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,919
that out there, but it doesn't matter.

543
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,559
This is where it went to. It reached up

544
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,679
into that level there at 1.19087.

545
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,760
That's this level here. And it was

546
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
basically a really, really tight

547
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,840
consolidation and straight shot right at

548
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,640
2:00. They rammed it up there first

549
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,440
stage and then rejection after taking

550
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,640
the relative equal highs here on the

551
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,480
weekly chart dropped it out fell out and

552
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,360
then this little area right here is the

553
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,120
only thing that I would have considered

554
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
tradable on euro

555
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,080
and all that would have been was using

556
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
the fair value gap here just to take out

557
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,840
that low. As soon as it would have went

558
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
below that low I would have been out. I

559
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,120
would not have been holding on to it

560
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
lower and that's the only thing I would

561
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,919
have done with the Euro dollar. Now this

562
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,679
is a fiveminute chart. So you know you

563
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,880
got to take that for what it's worth.

564
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,000
Admittedly you know Euro and and fiber

565
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,559
or I'm sorry Euro and fiber are the same

566
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,559
uh thing. I'm thinking cable. I haven't

567
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,000
talked about forex in a while. Little

568
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,360
rusty. um GBPUSD or cable and fiber

569
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,919
which is EuroUSD. Uh those two

570
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,159
currencies have been a little a little

571
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,080
sloppy. I mean if you're in a really

572
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
really smaller time frames less than one

573
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,159
minute I mean there yeah there's scalps

574
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,480
there you can take but it's just been

575
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
really

576
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,640
not very favorable

577
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,080
which is why I haven't talked much about

578
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,159
it but I will ring in Euro dollar. We'll

579
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,720
talk about cable and maybe um other

580
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,640
crosses, maybe some exotics, you like

581
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,080
the beast or something like that. Euro

582
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,880
yen. I don't like the yen crosses, but I

583
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
know a lot of you guys are interested in

584
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,679
looking at and having my opinion about

585
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
them. So, I'll share it when it's

586
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,520
pertinent. But for right now, uh that's

587
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,240
going to do it for tonight.

588
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,840
Thank you for your continued interest. I

589
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,360
hope you found this insightful tonight.

590
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
And until I talk to you next time, I

591
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,880
wish you good luck and good trading.
