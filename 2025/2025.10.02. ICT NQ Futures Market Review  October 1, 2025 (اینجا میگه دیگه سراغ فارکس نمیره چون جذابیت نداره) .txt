Good afternoon, folks. Just a quick
little review on doing it this way to
save myself some time. So, it is what it
is. All right. So, this morning I live
streamed and outlined a lot of things.
You can go watch the live stream.
I added it to the 2025 mentorship
playlist as this will be a part of that
playlist as well.
So I covered the uh Monday Tuesday
regular trading hours open range gap and
see how we use that later in the day
and rallied. So I'm going to strip these
things off as I mentioned them just to
clean up the chart.
And
this premium wick,
these gradient levels here,
248 111 and a quarter.
It's right behind this line here. Okay,
so that's the close of that candlestick
right there. And then the lower quadrant
comes in at 24,852
and a quarter.
up here.
Then 24893 and a half consequent
encroachment of this wick. That's this
level up here.
You can see how we worked around that
leveled
up into 24,934
and a half. That's the upper quadrant
level. And the high comes in at 24,975
and a half.
You can see that delivered here in the
afternoon. So, I'm going to take these
levels here and I'm going to just for
completeness sake, I'll show you this
913 and 3/4.
It's expecting it there.
for 8.95 and even
body's respecting that there.
So you get more bang for your buck by
having it on the larger as I gave you
for the rules. Okay.
So I'll take that off now. And I showed
you the opening range gap for today.
That's
all this business in here.
And back in here,
the details for the low I gave you
outlined it all live.
Engineered sellside liquidity here. It
drew up into the levels I mentioned
it would like to do. And we'll take
the
new day opening gap off.
And the Friday to Monday regular trading
hours
opening range gap. We'll take that off.
And the quadrant levels
don't need that anymore.
And once we ran the sell side here, the
liquidity was the old buy side.
I mentioned at the beginning of the
stream, I like those smooth
eyes
right in here.
We have a inversion fair value gap
and this consequent encroachment of this
wick right here price comes down hits
that so it's allowed to go outside of
the range is the inversion fair value
gap the wicks are allowed to do the
damage how far can they go Michael
consequent encroachment of the longest
wick don't use this one don't use that
one this is the longest one so
consequent encroachment is right there
rallies up you have another inversion
fair value gap there Beautiful delivery
to the tick there and rallies up. Now
this blue line is that old relative
equal high I told you at the beginning
of the stream and
these are the quadrants for the
uh
rear trading hours opening range gap for
today.
So we have
the low lower quadrant consequent
encroachment
upper quadrant and in the high
that off
first presented fair value gap is on
candlestick 931
and I have the gradient levels on that
too. We'll just use the uh actually
let's just do it
right. So we have the B side of L cell
side efficiency first present a fair
value gap
lower quadrant
consequent encouragement
inversion fair value gap and that comes
right in with the inversion fair value
gap and upper quadrant of the first
presented fair value gap. So you see how
there's a a confluence of several layers
of things supporting price for a
discount. So discount sensitivity
this is these are the things I have on
my piece of paper. Okay. And as new PD
arrays form like this one here and this
one here. And when the first value I got
forms if it's a large enough one and it
affords me to put the fib on to get the
gradient levels on it. I'll get those
and I'll write that down. Okay, so my
little piece of paper pad,
it's these things I'm writing on it.
Okay, I start the day off with what I
showed you this morning. Now, not just
that, but that's what I'm doing. I'm
looking at previous opening range gaps
in the last three days. I'm looking for
inefficiencies. I'm looking for daily
wicks, premium, and discount, and how
the market would use that information.
And I want to go back and show you
something here.
All right. So, this London low right
here, why did why did price tank right
there? Any any idea where you think that
um would have pulled down into that
here, that level? Now, classic support
and resistance guys,
they like to look at things like this.
They'll say,
"Oh, clearly ICT's behind the times and
he doesn't know about support and
resistance.
So this old high here, okay, it broke
through that. So naturally, they would
expect it to be support here. But you
can see how well that worked. It just
ripped right through it and then the
market rallies up.
I'm sorry, opens here, r uh rallies down
back down into that level. But look, it
goes a little bit past that. See, that's
see that's the thing that plagued me all
the time as a young man. I didn't like
that. Okay, I I wanted to be a little
bit more precise because if it was in
fact the theory behind why price should
move up and down, then it should be a
lot more sensitive than this. This looks
erratic to me and it looked very erratic
to an obsessive, compulsive and younger
man that I was back in my 20s. So now
let's go in and look at the smart money
concept
of my fair gap. So, if we look at this
candlestick right here, okay, this
candlestick on September 19th, the
opening price, you're going to look
right up here, okay? Upper lefthand
corner,
24,717.75.
Okay, so just remember the last two
digits 17.75.
Is it higher or lower? If I go to the
previous candle's close, so 17.75
and the close of that previous candle.
I can't remember if I said open or
close. It's this candle that's open
rather 24,717.75
and then the close of this one and it's
17
I'm sorry 713.75.
So there is a volume imbalance. Okay.
And you might see this with better
younger eyes and say, "Well, that's
obvious." To me, it's it's very hard to
see that. So,
I have to check my math sometimes here.
I've been guilty of uh
putting volume imbalances to the
wayside, not noticing that they're there
because I'm trying to go through the
material quick and get through it. So,
here's a bullish fair value gap, okay? A
buy side of balance, sell side, and
efficiency. And here's the consequent
encroachment of that level. Okay. So if
we roll that forward into today,
that low right here is that low right
there. And that is what I found as a
better form of what would be considered
quote unquote support or resistance. Not
viewed in the same light that a retail
trader would expect it. They would not
consider that.
But because Smart mind concepts are
better than that archaic uh nonsense of
retail support resistance.
You would expect that. So it dives down
into algorithmically right into the
middle of this fair value gap. Again,
we're not support I'm Yeah, we're not
support resistance and we're not supply
and demand. We cut through all these
candlesticks and go right back to that
level right there of the fair value guy
and the consequent encroachment of that
level takes us right to that level right
there. So, not only did I give you the
New York session low and told you it's
what it was, this is how you can see the
London open low. Okay? And then you roll
this information into what I was doing
in Forex when you watch me run those
accounts up into astronomical levels
real quick. Boom, boom, boom. and
showing my ex executions and all that
you just too perfect. It's because I was
using this stuff here. Okay? When I'm
when I'm using this information
and I'm dialed in and I have no reason
to be talking about anything because I'm
just focusing on trading,
it's just it's it's poetic. It's it's
just beautiful. It's just like
well it's art. And
when you get better at this, and don't
expect to learn how to do this real
fast. Don't expect to be real quick
about it, okay? Take your time, learn to
find yourself in this, and view it as a
form of meditation. When you go through
your charts and you look through old PD
arrays and and try to see what rhyme or
reason there is using the language I've
given you, you will get more and more
insight every time you do it. If you're
someone that's going to be lazy, and I
don't mean it derogatory,
I mean it in a way where if you're going
to be lazy and don't spend that much
time in doing it and don't find time
doing it and enjoying it, it's going to
be real hard for you to get better at
it. It'll feel like it's just outside
your reach all the time. And I don't
want you to feel that way. I want you to
find enjoyment. Put some really nice
relaxing music on and just simply go
through your charts and annotate them.
really mark them up and and
really cherish the idea that these
concepts keep repeating and they're
something that you can learn and they're
very very precise. Daily highs and lows,
it's never been a problem for me. My
more mature veteran students, they're
getting better at it and you'll get
better at it, too. You'll learn how to
do it, but you only need to get the meat
in between. You don't need to get the
lowest tick low and the highest tick
high. But the the draw on liquidity, as
I mentioned this morning, it could
create all-time high. It could,
and it did. Relative equal highs.
There's your high right there. And it
ran up there and pierced it. So 25,27.25
25 got blitzed with a high today at
25,36.75
and it looks like it wants to make a
little bit more of a you know a ram rod
through that way we opened up here. So
it's usually indicative of them wanting
to maybe flirt with a little bit going
lower and just send that a little bit
higher again. Okay, I wouldn't be trying
to chase it here. just waiting for
regular trading hours tomorrow and see
how they open up if they give us a
discount or premium gap and use the
information like I showed you today. I
had fun today. I hope you enjoyed it and
until I talk to you
I guess tomorrow. Um Lord willing be
safe. I'm not going to do anything with
Forex because basically it was a joke.
It was it was very very ugly. Look at
your charts and you'll see and you'll
agree it's just it's just trash right
now. So otherwise,
have a good night, good morning, and
I'll see you when I see you.
