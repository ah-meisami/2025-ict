1
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
audio check real quick. See if I can

2
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,920
hear myself.

3
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,439
All

4
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,840
right,

5
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
I'm gonna

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,159
live stream

7
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,600
the review. I was going to do it.

8
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,320
Usually takes me so much time to do

9
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
these things, the uh between the

10
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,159
compression software that makes the

11
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
the video for you guys to be able to see

12
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
it on YouTube, them putting it up on

13
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,320
YouTube, and they do all their business

14
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,079
with it.

15
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,280
it it just to save some time.

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,079
I'm probably going to have some uh

17
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,200
things in here that I would normally

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
want to edit out. You're just going to

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
have to just accept it. Okay. I'm really

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
short on time.

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,840
But we're looking at the dollar index

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,440
uh daily chart on the lefth hand side.

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,319
Uh we traded up into

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
nothing here is going to be time

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
sensitive. So, don't be upset with me if

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,000
you don't get the alert from YouTube or

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
or I didn't tweet it or or something to

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
that effect. This is just for my benefit

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
to get it done quickly. Uh, but we have

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
a old buy side of balance sellside

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,959
efficiency and that's we're we're stuck

32
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,599
inside that right now. So, it hasn't

33
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,239
really done much in regards to moving

34
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
beyond that. There's buy side resting

35
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,040
here

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,080
and then there is

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
the consequent encroachment of the

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,599
suspension block in here. We already

39
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,159
traded there. So any movement back down

40
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,080
in would be problematic in my opinion

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
because we've already done enough in

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
here for the suspension block to yield

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,560
its help in terms of supporting prices

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,760
and up into higher prices. So I don't

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
want to personally see if dollar stays

46
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,800
firm I don't want to see this

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
area in here give up the ghost I don't

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
want to see anything traded down below

49
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,319
consequent encouragement I don't even

50
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
want to see it trade back to it at all

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,519
now can it touch the lower quadrant of

52
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,599
that daily bounce sellside sign

53
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,599
efficiency that's shaded in pink here

54
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
can it do that sure can prefer it not do

55
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,560
that like it's done so far see how it's

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
come down real low to it but it hasn't

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,080
done the actual touch. So, that's good.

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,280
And you're going to hear my puppies in

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
the background cuz Piper's outside right

60
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
behind me and she's wanting me to go

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
outside and play with her. Her little

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
squeaky toy. So, I can't do anything

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
about that. These are all things I would

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
usually pause the video and edit it all

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,959
out, but I can't. I don't have the

66
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,360
luxury of doing that today. So, here's

67
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
the business on the fiveminute chart.

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,159
Dollar index. And we came down, cleared

69
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
some sellside here, there rallied up. We

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,319
had a breaker that's normally a bearish

71
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
structure when it's like this. And when

72
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,600
we trade above it, it acts as an

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,440
inversion breaker. We see that traded

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,840
here. And they left relative equal highs

75
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,400
up here. So this to me, you know,

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
it's kind of tricky to be honest with

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,080
you because we have these on the buy

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
side, but we also have the sell side

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,919
down here.

80
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,720
So that's why I'm telling you dollar

81
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,759
index is kind of like it can go either

82
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,000
way and either side getting hit here or

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
here could send it the other direction

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,600
to get the opposite liquidity. I'll give

85
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
you an example what I mean by that. It

86
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,199
could come down here take this liquidity

87
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,120
and then come all the way back up and

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,520
take that or it can come up here and

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
grab that and then go down here. So it's

90
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
kind of like a if then if it does this

91
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,560
then I'll do that. If it does that then

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,040
I'll do this. So,

93
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,960
I don't trade dollar index, but you

94
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,639
know, right now with all the things

95
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,160
that's going on around the world, you

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,759
know, I'm surprised that dollar is where

97
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,320
it's at right now, to be honest with

98
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,720
you, with gold, you know, surging above

99
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,759
4,000, you know, plus. Uh, it's just

100
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,000
well, it's a little

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,639
against the grain for a dollar to be

102
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,720
performing like it's doing here. I would

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,919
expect it to be in a smaller

104
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
consolidation or trading lower. That's

105
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
what I would expect. But it's not doing

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,639
that, which is in a way kind of like a

107
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,720
decoupling. And it's not surprising

108
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
because there's so many things going on

109
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,199
geopolitically, economically. You know,

110
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,199
our government's a bunch of clowns. You

111
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,720
all of those senators should have their

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,880
pay stopped and frozen. If they want to

113
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,080
shut the government down, they should

114
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,120
they should be part of the government

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,199
shutdown. Their pay stops. you know,

116
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,960
they want to stop the military pay

117
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,199
paychecks and whatnot, the federal

118
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,280
employees. If they get the pay cut

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,720
stopped, then the senators should have

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
to stop. Then we probably get things

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
done. But there's so many things going

122
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,919
on.

123
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
It is very difficult to just lean on the

124
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,680
dollar index because the dollar index is

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
not doing anything that you would expect

126
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,960
it to do right now given the climate,

127
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
given the technicals of everything else

128
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,800
that's going on in the marketplace. So

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,000
anyway, um

130
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,639
those are the two pools of liquidity I'm

131
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,720
looking for. So I'm kind of neutral on

132
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
dollar. I want to I want to see it stay

133
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,199
firm, but if it goes lower, it goes

134
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,240
lower to take this sell side. That's the

135
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,840
only interest I'd have. If it goes down

136
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,039
below that and then really starts to

137
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,199
fall out of bed,

138
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,680
then I think that we'll probably see

139
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,600
all-time highs resume in equities. And

140
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,280
I'll get to that in a minute when we go

141
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,960
get to the NASDAQ part, but I want to

142
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,199
kind of get through this stuff. So,

143
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,199
we're looking at uh Euro Dollar next.

144
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,199
All this is just is just my opinion. So,

145
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,639
none of this should be used for for

146
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,840
trading purposes or anything like that.

147
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
We did disclaimer down in the video

148
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
description. It's always there. So, the

149
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
business here on the Euro dollar, uh, we

150
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
had buy sell side efficiency. I sent

151
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,960
these charts in the levels I was

152
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,000
interested in on Telegram this morning

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,599
cuz I I started thinking to myself like

154
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
if I don't share the levels I'm

155
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,280
interested in beforehand, it won't have

156
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,160
the same impact I hope would would have

157
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,319
when I shared the analysis or not the

158
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,880
analysis but the the call out on NASDAQ

159
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,199
on X. If you're not following me on X,

160
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
uh I'll do my best to try to remember to

161
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
put the link to the post I'm going to

162
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,960
refer to here in this in this

163
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
discussion, but uh over 700,000 of you

164
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,160
saw me tweet about it and call it you to

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
the tick today. So, looking at Euro

166
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,560
Dollar,

167
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
uh we're we're sitting inside of a

168
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
pretty difficult sloppy range in here.

169
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,919
Um, I think personally, uh, because

170
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,879
we've made it jagged on the upside here,

171
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
a deeper retracement down into this buy

172
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
side and balance sellside efficiency is

173
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,599
warranted. I think it would be, um,

174
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,120
helpful,

175
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
but reverse the script for a second.

176
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,599
Play devil's advocate in your own

177
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,520
analysis. And this is what I like to do.

178
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,680
If I'm wrong, how would I be wrong? And

179
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,159
what would it be going for if I'm wrong?

180
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,320
Well, we have relative equal highs and

181
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
that are real, real smooth. And that's

182
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,719
really sold the idea that that's strong

183
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,880
what retail resistance and you can

184
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
already see they're trying to you muscle

185
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,120
their way up in there. So we dug down

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,959
into this buy side balance sell sign

187
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,480
efficiency on the daily charts already.

188
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
And if we can muster the strength to get

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
back above

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,680
the immediate rebalance I showed here on

191
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,160
the the daily chart. It's trading at

192
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,240
essentially the 11649.

193
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
So that's

194
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
above these obviously. So if it runs

195
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
that and goes above and closes on a

196
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,399
closing base on the daily chart above

197
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,320
the immediate rebalance, then we're

198
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,839
probably looking at some kind of

199
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,480
internal shift that would pre

200
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,839
potentially send dollar lower or stay in

201
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,120
a very narrow consolidation permitting

202
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
the euro and cable and other uh FX pairs

203
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,399
to move without its participation. as

204
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
you would expect it to be the opposite.

205
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,279
Whatever the currency like euro, cable,

206
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,440
um, yen, whatever, they would go one

207
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
direction and dollar would go the other.

208
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,959
That's the normal dichotomy between. But

209
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,360
it's not always like that. Sometimes the

210
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,839
dollar is held

211
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,680
and then the other currencies are

212
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
allowed to to move around. And when it's

213
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,200
like that, you will see the crosses like

214
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,240
Euro pound, euroyen,

215
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,560
um Aussie yen, all the the non

216
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
dollarbased

217
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,839
currency pairs, they will do exceedingly

218
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,360
well. They'll have a whole lot more

219
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,880
movement and they'll have freedom to

220
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,440
allow the market to do whatever, you

221
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,800
know, wherever it wants to go. it'll go

222
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
there quickly and it'll do it

223
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,399
dynamically all the while while the

224
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,640
dollar index doesn't do anything at all

225
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
which sometimes is confusing for someone

226
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
that's trying to trade forex but that's

227
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,600
a you that's a condition that can happen

228
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
in the marketplace.

229
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,440
So

230
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
moving on into I kind of like quickly

231
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
want to get into the NASDAQ because I'm

232
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
not so much interested in Forex. I know

233
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
majority of you are Forex freaks, but uh

234
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
I just I'm not touching those currency

235
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,040
pairs, but I promised I would give my

236
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
opinion on them for whatever it's worth.

237
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,040
And you may not think it's worth much at

238
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,560
all.

239
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,000
That's okay. It's free.

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,959
All right. So, here is the

241
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,120
cable market. Okay. And I shared these

242
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,720
uh charts in the Telegram channel this

243
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
morning.

244
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,880
And you can see this discount I'm sorry

245
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,720
this yeah it's a discount array but it's

246
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
a premium wick. So when price is up here

247
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,360
and it's trading down

248
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,120
the natural tendency is to think okay

249
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
well classic support and resistance

250
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,120
theory would be this down here is where

251
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
they would expect price to trade down to

252
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
that low and then bounce or break below

253
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,800
it retest and keep going lower. I'm not

254
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
supporting resistance.

255
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
School of thought from ICT would be

256
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
while you're up here, it might want to

257
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,240
trade down to this candlesticks open,

258
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
which is to change in a state of

259
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,120
delivery for the order blocks furthest

260
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,640
uh

261
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,519
discount candle. This this is the lowest

262
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,040
one in the series of all these down

263
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
close candles. So, that would be a

264
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,240
change in the state of delivery. It

265
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,839
would be reasonable to expect that, but

266
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,519
I'm not. If I'm looking for lower

267
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,120
prices, I would look for that as a like

268
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,800
a speed bump, maybe a mile marker, but I

269
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
would want to see it then get into this

270
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,240
wick. Okay, so that's the reason why I

271
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
shared these levels in here. And also

272
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
this one, this would be the one that

273
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,560
would you would use. Let me bring it a

274
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,240
little bit wider so you can see it. I

275
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,839
know some of you guys complain, but you

276
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
should be able to zoom in on the

277
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
playback. If not, I don't know why you

278
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,120
wouldn't be able to. But here is the

279
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,760
premium wick. When price is up here and

280
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,120
it's trading down, that's going to act

281
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,800
as a inversion. So if it's premium on

282
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
the candlestick, but price is above it,

283
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
the algorithm will see that as a

284
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,440
discount array. And we treat wicks like

285
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,200
gaps. So in in full theory, it would

286
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,480
look like this.

287
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
All levels

288
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,639
for this. And I'm just going to take

289
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,279
this one off just for for clarity sake.

290
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,320
There might be a little too many things

291
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,800
on the chart for you to follow along.

292
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,560
But in here, this premium wick is a

293
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,399
level that the market will draw into

294
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,399
when price is above it. So, if market

295
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,560
price is above this specific

296
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
candlestick, and you're probably

297
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,839
thinking, well, why am I using this one

298
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,320
and not this one? Because isn't this the

299
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,000
tallest one, the highest one? It is, but

300
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,240
you got to think in terms of when prices

301
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,200
are high and the market price is above

302
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,760
every PD rate that you would have in

303
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
indicated on your chart. This is the

304
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,040
lowest wick. So, this would be the most

305
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,720
in terms of a premium wick. Every every

306
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,880
wick above the candlestick's body, this

307
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,320
would be the candlestick that you would

308
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,040
or I would rather anticipate reaching

309
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,160
down into if there is no interest at all

310
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,200
trading to consequent I'm not changing

311
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,800
state. See that would be an edit point

312
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
right there. The opening of this price

313
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,920
here would be the change to say

314
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,160
delivery. So for order block PD uh array

315
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,639
that would be the the level to draw to.

316
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,000
But what happens if it doesn't want to

317
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,920
go down there? Then you have to consider

318
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
every one of these wicks. And since

319
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,399
there's a series of them, you want to

320
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,720
concern yourself with what's the lowest

321
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,959
one it could trade to, and it's this one

322
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,920
here. There's nothing wrong with grading

323
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,079
this wick here. And you if you do it,

324
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,199
you'll see there's levels that it's

325
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
tapping and using. But in terms of a D

326
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,800
retracement moving lower, my eye goes

327
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
right here because that's going to be

328
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,440
treated as a gap.

329
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,000
Moving over to market price. Now you can

330
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,040
see we traded down to the lowest

331
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,680
quadrant, but not the low of that wick.

332
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,880
Piper's really trying to get my

333
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
attention. I'm not sure if you guys can

334
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,320
hear her squeaky toy, but it's driving

335
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,480
me nuts. But here's the open of that

336
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,279
candlestick and it's this price here.

337
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,560
But the lower quadrant, not the high,

338
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,680
not the upper quadrant, not the

339
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
consequent encroachment, but the lower

340
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,920
quadrant level at 1.32495.

341
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,079
That level there is exactly what you see

342
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,800
delivered to here.

343
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
And price rallied above. And then we use

344
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,000
the high of that wick right there, which

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,199
is at 1.32822.

346
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,920
Hits it here and then it rallies and

347
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,839
starting to run back up. So looking at

348
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,800
these highs here, we have potentially a

349
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,959
high probability candidate for drawing

350
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,560
liquidity because we have the lower high

351
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
to the right than that one. So your buy

352
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,279
side should be drawn on at around the

353
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,800
13370 level or thereabouts.

354
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,240
And then your sell side would obviously

355
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,800
be the low here and then into this

356
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,600
candlestick's open and then you would

357
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
grade that wick down here if it starts

358
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,480
to break down lower. But we've had

359
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,320
several attempts now. We hit the high of

360
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
it, this wick here. We hit that one. We

361
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,560
went to the upper quadrant, failed to

362
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,760
get to consequent encouragement. And

363
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,720
then we went through consequent

364
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,079
encouragement and went right to the

365
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,839
lower quadrant of that one there. And

366
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,759
this is a lot of give back. So if I were

367
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,639
short, I' I'd be concerned because we've

368
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,600
already done enough reaching down here.

369
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,279
So where it's at now, you know, it's

370
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,519
it's concerned for short-term bearish,

371
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,560
you know, bearishness.

372
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,480
Uh gold, I said I would talk about that

373
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,480
this week. And let's do that now.

374
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,120
I shared again these charts. Uh, see, Z

375
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,279
is the contract month, delivery,

376
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,279
December.

377
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,040
And you can do everything I'm showing

378
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,480
you here. Everything I'm showing you

379
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
with the futures contract for gold. When

380
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,440
you're when you're tape reading, we're

381
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,720
not trading. I'm not giving you trade

382
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
advice. I'm not giving you investment

383
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,600
advice. I'm not telling you to buy or

384
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,399
sell anything. But when you're looking

385
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,199
at your your levels in relationship to

386
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,560
what I'm showing you here on the futures

387
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,079
contract,

388
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,199
pull up the symbol GC Z205

389
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,360
like you just watched me do here. And

390
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,120
then if you are a CFD trader, if you're

391
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,240
outside the United States because we're

392
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
not allowed legally to trade them in the

393
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,639
US, but I know there's a lot of you that

394
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,160
are students around the world that you

395
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,440
don't have the luxury of trading the

396
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,120
futures contract unless you're trading

397
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,319
these funded account companies, which

398
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,919
you're still not trading the futures uh

399
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,760
contract anyway. You're in a demo

400
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,160
account. But in deference to the folks

401
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,319
that are trading CFDs,

402
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,199
you want to match up the time candle

403
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,760
that I'm anchoring to on the futures

404
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
contract. Everything I'm showing you

405
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
here, match that up to the time candle

406
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,960
for your CFD. So, AU, I'm sorry, X AUSD,

407
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,919
for instance, if that's what you're

408
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,160
going to be trading with or not trading

409
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,679
with, but doing you doing your analysis

410
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,120
and studying with, that would be uh how

411
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,280
you match this up. Okay? So, everything

412
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,559
I'm going to show you here, you do the

413
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,880
same thing that way. I gave you some

414
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,919
hints the other day about using the uh

415
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,000
the same times that I use for regular

416
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,200
trading hours for equities and we'll

417
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,160
cover a little bit more detail about

418
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
that in a moment. But uh the daily chart

419
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,000
here on the lefth hand side you see we

420
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,200
had a buy side of balance sell side

421
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,280
efficiency is shaded in blue. Uh notice

422
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,799
that it had no interest at all getting

423
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,200
down to the upper quadrant. It used the

424
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
top the top end of the which is this

425
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,880
candlesticks low. It hit once here twice

426
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,320
and then said I got to go. And that is

427
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
what you want to see when you're in a

428
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,960
bullish market. When you're looking for

429
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,200
bullishness, you do not want to see my

430
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,520
fair value gaps traded down into. You

431
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
don't want to see them go to their

432
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
quadrants. You certainly don't want to

433
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,880
see them go to consequent encroachment.

434
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
You don't want to see them completely

435
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
close in. Um there's so many people out

436
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,039
there that think that, you know, I want

437
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,679
every inefficiency closed in or it must

438
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,919
close in. That's not what I taught. I'm

439
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,520
not Chris Lori. That's what Chris Lori

440
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,919
teaches. That stuff is flawed logic. You

441
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,760
have to have inefficiencies left open to

442
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
indicate what? Strength. And if you're

443
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,880
bullish, you want to see inefficiencies

444
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,360
not be offered as a a fulfillment lower.

445
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,559
Because if the premium is real and and

446
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,600
it's an instrument that is technically

447
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
undervalued,

448
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,240
why would they offer the discount price?

449
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
They wouldn't. If you had the hottest

450
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,880
thing right now that everybody wanted to

451
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
buy at Christmas time, would you offer

452
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
sale prices on it? No. You're going to

453
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
keep increasing the price higher,

454
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
higher, higher. Well, that's what the

455
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
algorithm does. It just keeps offering

456
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,919
higher price. And everybody's doing

457
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,520
market orders all the time. There's

458
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,720
somebody out there doing a market order

459
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,559
all the time. That's why when I tell you

460
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
stop looking at these DOMs, these depth

461
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,480
of markets, these ladders, you these

462
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
level two things. There's no advantage

463
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,559
in that because the same number of

464
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,120
contracts above the marketplace price

465
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,039
and below. It's it's a it's a bracket.

466
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,440
There's no advantage. There's no

467
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,360
imbalance at all. There's the same

468
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
number of contracts spread across

469
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
everything. Okay? If you look at it that

470
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,640
way, and the only thing you have is a

471
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,400
religion believing that that has some

472
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,559
kind of insight that's yielding to you

473
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,240
the prognostication that you hope it

474
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,120
has. And there's it's just an illusion.

475
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,320
Now, when we're looking at

476
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
inefficiencies like this, we want to see

477
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,360
price literally stay open because if the

478
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,000
inefficiencies can stay open or fail to

479
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,320
even touch the quadrant levels and it

480
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,200
starts to rally, man, if you're long,

481
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,559
that's when you want to start adding to

482
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,400
your longs. You want to build in larger

483
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
positions. That means every time you

484
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,160
have a short-term retracement, anything

485
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,840
intraday, you want to build that

486
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,360
position up. Build it up. Build it up.

487
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
Build it up because it's already

488
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
indicating strength. And if you go back

489
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,799
and look at what I said on X or if

490
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
you've been with me for a long time,

491
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
you know, back in 2016 before Trump was

492
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,159
even elected, I said that we would see

493
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,080
3,000, 4,000, and as much as 5,000 gold.

494
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
And go back, if you're a student of

495
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
mine, you have all these things in

496
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
recording. I don't need to find them.

497
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
You have them. And people, you people

498
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,679
were laughing, you know, when I was

499
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,039
saying those things. I said, listen, you

500
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,320
know, before Trump even got elected, I

501
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,600
said, he's going to be elected and

502
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,960
they're going to use him as a fall guy.

503
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,159
He's going to get the blame for

504
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,280
everything. Everything. Now, the only

505
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
thing I was wrong about was his first

506
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
term. They didn't do it. They They built

507
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
this division between everybody. And I'm

508
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,280
I'm getting somewhere with this. But

509
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,799
they built this division and they made

510
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,840
teams. Team Trump, team non-Trump. And

511
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
I'm indifferent. I'm neither. Okay? So,

512
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
I'm staying objective because I don't

513
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
vote. I've never voted. And my opinion

514
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
is valid because I'm not part of

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
anybody's team. I have no affiliation

516
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
with either side. I'm not Democrat. I'm

517
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
not Republican. I'm not independent. I

518
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
think it's the same bird. It's the same

519
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,120
coin. Two different sides. You're

520
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,679
falling victim to it. And I don't

521
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,520
subscribe to it. I don't I don't fall

522
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
victim to the left right paradigm. And

523
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
you can if you want to be a liberal, you

524
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,919
want to be a Democrat, you want to be a

525
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,039
conservative, you want to be a

526
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,039
hardrightist, you know, libertarian,

527
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,159
whatever you want to call yourself, I

528
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,919
could care less. But those things,

529
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,440
okay, blind us as investors because we

530
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
have a sub we have a subscription to the

531
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,039
team mentality.

532
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,760
And it's real hard as an educator to try

533
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,559
to break through that barrier.

534
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,880
And I know that when I say certain

535
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
things, people just don't want to

536
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
believe it. But in 2016, I said he would

537
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,320
be elected. I said he would be used to

538
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,559
crash the economy

539
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,240
and he would be the one that they put

540
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,080
all the blame on. And it didn't happen

541
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,799
in his first term. And then Knox

542
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,440
obviously, you know, 2020 was rigged and

543
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,480
you can believe whatever you want to

544
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
believe about, but they even brought the

545
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
evidence out. It's it was cooked.

546
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,039
He won this time and everybody expected

547
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
him to come in like the white knight and

548
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,200
fix everything. But it has a different

549
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,039
feeling, doesn't it? A whole lot of

550
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,320
stuff's going on right now. And the

551
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,159
things that he's campaigned on, I don't

552
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,000
see it happening. And maybe you see it,

553
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,919
but I don't see it happening. I see a

554
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
lot of things that are unconstitutional

555
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,960
really. And you can be mad about that

556
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,000
and that's not the point of this

557
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,760
conversation, but that idea of

558
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,919
separation

559
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,159
between the normal, what should be

560
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,559
allowed, what shouldn't be allowed. Um,

561
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,840
it's it's it's culminating into a huge

562
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,400
problem. It's a storm. All those things

563
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,799
are fueling gold.

564
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,440
Nobody trusts their money in banks.

565
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,640
Nobody trusts their money just sitting

566
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,720
in like money market or CDs because

567
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
you're not getting any interest. And

568
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,520
nobody's trusting the dollar anymore.

569
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,440
Not in the US, not abroad. And the BRICS

570
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,679
nations are working towards trying to

571
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,679
develop a gold back currency as a

572
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,840
replacement for the green back their

573
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,360
dollar because it's the global reserve

574
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,440
currency. and they're really trying to

575
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,280
remove that and I personally think that

576
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,200
it's going to be successful. It may not

577
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,440
be bricks nations that's doing it

578
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,360
eventually. Uh but they have the best

579
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,159
advantage in my opinion if anybody does

580
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,039
at this moment but eventually the dollar

581
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,880
will be replaced with something and

582
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,919
that's what we're watching. We're

583
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,880
watching the deconstruction of that and

584
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,280
all those things is what I talked about

585
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,679
in 2016 before he even got elected. And

586
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,440
look around it's happening. I said we'd

587
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,039
see military in our streets. We're

588
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,799
seeing military in our streets. You

589
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,159
know, we're we're going to see worse

590
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,760
things than that. And all of that

591
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,440
uncertainty is putting more emphasis on

592
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,559
securing it, money, wealth in gold and

593
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,440
silver is the poor man's gold. And we

594
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,520
have just breached the Hunt Brothers

595
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,360
debacle where they cornered the market a

596
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
long couple decades ago. Uh it was

597
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,799
before I started trading, but we're in

598
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,440
we're in alltime highs there, too. And

599
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,400
that market can go anywhere, man. Like,

600
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
you have no idea where silver can go. I

601
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,799
don't know where it can go. I just know

602
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,159
I'm not trying to pick a top in that

603
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,600
market and I'm not trying to pick pick a

604
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,159
top in the gold market because nothing

605
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,400
has changed. In fact, everything that's

606
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,880
led up to right now, it's gotten worse

607
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,799
and it's on the horizon potentially even

608
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,039
getting more worse than that. So, I'm

609
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,159
not trying to be a Debbie doomer

610
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
gloomer, but you know, as an investor,

611
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,159
you have to be able to weigh these

612
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,600
things and not lose your mind over the

613
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,440
emotional sides of it. You know, don't

614
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,520
don't come at me because you're a

615
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,799
Democrat and you think I said something

616
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,559
to offend you. Don't come at me as a a

617
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,919
conservative and say, "Well, you should

618
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,120
have did this and can't you see Trump's

619
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,880
doing I could care less." Okay? I really

620
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,640
don't care. I I I'm not going to lose

621
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,360
any sleep over it. I don't care if oil

622
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,080
goes to $250 a barrel. I'm still going

623
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,679
to drive eight cylinder cars. I'm going

624
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,440
to drive vets. I'm going to none of this

625
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,279
is going to affect me. It's not going to

626
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,600
affect me. Okay? I will find a way to

627
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
outpace all their I ain't

628
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,240
worried about it. But the point is is if

629
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
you're trying to learn how to do this,

630
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
you have to have a perception that's

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,600
outside the normal realm of retail. And

632
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,080
even if you understood an imbalance in

633
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,720
price action, even if you understood um

634
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,360
you know valuation and price action,

635
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,840
leaving inefficiencies open like this is

636
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,679
exactly what you want to see if you're

637
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,760
bullish and when prices is going lower.

638
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,600
If it's leaving inefficiencies open and

639
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
it doesn't come back up into them, if it

640
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,960
can't even touch the lower quadrant when

641
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
you're bearish,

642
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
that's really bearish. Well, in the same

643
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,120
sense here, just reversing it, when it's

644
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,279
bullish like this, we don't even want to

645
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,200
see it trade down in the upper quadrant

646
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,960
and it doesn't do that. And go back and

647
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,880
look at the tweet. I just said it a

648
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,080
little while ago. So, we're, you know,

649
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,440
we're going to see 4,000 and I don't see

650
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
it stopping there. You know, I I see

651
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,480
5,000 gold easy. Like, I see it. It's

652
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
it's it's no reason for it not to be

653
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,279
there. There's

654
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,960
a ton of people that want Bitcoin to go

655
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,799
to a million. Okay. And if Bitcoin was

656
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,000
supposed to be this isolation from fiat,

657
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
then it should have never had what it

658
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,679
had happened to it last Friday. And you

659
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,039
can hate me all you want about that, but

660
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,279
that's just the truth. That that's when

661
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,919
it should have went straight up and did

662
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,799
another quarter, you know, you know,

663
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,559
whatever percentage you want to call it,

664
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,640
just had an extrapolated move. That's

665
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,840
what it should have been. That's what it

666
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,760
was sold to you as the public. You

667
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,880
you're believing that's what it's

668
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,000
supposed to do. Well, it didn't do any

669
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,600
of that, did it? And I know people now

670
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
that lost fortunes in that trash. And

671
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,080
literally some of them, I don't know

672
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
these people, but some of them out there

673
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,279
that have traded big time, they don't

674
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,880
they don't even live anymore. They kill

675
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
themselves. Now think about that. That's

676
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,799
nuts. You're overleveraged. Your

677
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,080
expectations are too high. You're

678
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,039
punched drunk. And you don't want to see

679
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,279
it any other way. These markets right

680
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,320
now, all of them are in conditions that

681
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,880
could literally wipe you out. And I know

682
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,640
a lot of you listening are playing these

683
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,919
demo accounts because you're trading in

684
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,200
funded account companies where it's not

685
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
even real money. And you think, what's

686
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,320
the worst could happen? Well,

687
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,000
in in certain respects, I guess I can

688
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,159
agree with you there. You're only going

689
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,000
to have to pay whatever you pay to reset

690
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,240
or what you you pay per month to keep

691
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,200
the accounts open.

692
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,840
But you shouldn't be going hog wild and

693
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
going here and trying to, you know, bet

694
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,600
the farm on everything, expecting big,

695
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,279
you know, lottery wins. Don't do that.

696
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,039
You need to have rule-based ideas and

697
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,919
things that lean on that you can trust.

698
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,919
And one of the things that I found the

699
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,960
most trust in is when my fair value gaps

700
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,720
form in price action, if they can't draw

701
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,600
price down into them and I'm bullish,

702
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,640
I'm wildly bullish then. Like I'm really

703
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,399
bullish and every indication post fair a

704
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,919
gap not being traded into like it does

705
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,200
here. Everything past that on intraday

706
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
that's a discount array should be

707
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,640
considered as a reason to go higher. And

708
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,000
you you can see the price action here.

709
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,760
It's just a straight run up. It's

710
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
they're not letting this thing go down.

711
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
They don't want it to go down. And

712
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
they've already indicated down here that

713
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,640
it shouldn't because it's kept at bay.

714
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,480
It won't it won't go to a discount when

715
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
this inefficiency right here. Let me let

716
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,520
me move this over so you can see a

717
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,679
little bit easier. This candlesticks

718
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,360
low. This candlesticks high in between

719
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,600
those two points. This candle's high.

720
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,840
That candlesticks low. This portion of

721
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,799
price action should have

722
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,520
it should have

723
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,720
carried the market down to at least half

724
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,200
and then rally. That's a normal bullish

725
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,600
market. That's normal. Can it come all

726
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,120
the way down, fill that in, and go up?

727
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,039
Yes, it can do that. But when it does

728
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,279
that, I'm far less bullish on the

729
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,399
marketplace. I would want something

730
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,960
after it closes the fair value gap in. I

731
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,799
would want something over here, create a

732
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,640
new shift in market structure on a

733
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,720
smaller time frame and then look for the

734
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,000
same event where it doesn't fill in a

735
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,679
fair value gap and then I would resume

736
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,760
going in looking for longs. I don't like

737
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,559
to trade a full closure of a fair value

738
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,960
gap. I like to do that when I'm short

739
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,080
and if it trades down there, that's

740
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,559
where I'm trying to take profits. But I

741
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,279
do not like to buy a full closure of a

742
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,200
fair value gap when it's a buy side and

743
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,480
balance sell side efficiency and I'm

744
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,320
bullish. I don't ever want to go in

745
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
there and do that. Look at my trades. Do

746
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
you ever see me executing like that?

747
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,240
It's never happening, folks. It's never

748
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,799
happening. You learn more from studying

749
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,799
my executions

750
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,200
than trying to you come up with these,

751
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
you know, hypothetical. He's doing this,

752
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
he's doing that. Just look at what I'm

753
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,039
doing. I mean, look at where I'm

754
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,440
entering. I'm entering at the best

755
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,799
places at the best time

756
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,720
and I'm looking at areas where they

757
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,399
don't fully close in or I'm entering

758
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,960
just after that's occurred.

759
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
That's like the biggest tip and hint I

760
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,240
could give you as a smart money

761
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,480
operator. Like I'm telling you literally

762
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,080
that is worth its weight in gold.

763
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
Nobody talks about that. They all want

764
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,760
to see these closures. That's that's

765
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,279
that's not what I I've never taught

766
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,600
that. That has never been coming out of

767
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,520
my mouth. That's never come out. I don't

768
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,320
want to take those trades. I I don't

769
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,399
mean that it can't happen. Yeah, that's

770
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,240
sure it can happen. But I'm not going to

771
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
enter on that basis alone. I want to see

772
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,919
it. If it's going to do that, then I

773
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,760
want to see it give me some more proof

774
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,200
that it needs to climb to the upper half

775
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
of that inefficiency.

776
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Then give me some kind of a smaller one

777
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
minute, five minute time frame shift in

778
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
market structure where it gives another

779
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,360
fractal form of this bigger buy side

780
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,880
balance sellside efficiency just done on

781
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,360
a smaller time frame.

782
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,080
And then if it can fail to fill in that

783
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,320
one, then I'll start going in there and

784
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
filing order flow that way. But you just

785
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,159
can't go in here and just simply say,

786
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,840
"Well, there's an inefficiency and I'm

787
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,279
going to get real real bullish once it

788
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,600
goes there and I'm going to buy that."

789
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,000
Because think about it, if it's going to

790
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
go higher, and you want to be in markets

791
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,880
that want to go higher if you're

792
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,559
bullish. And if you want to be in a

793
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,600
bullish market, you want to be in a

794
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
bullish market that's going to take off

795
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,320
and just run and run and run. If you

796
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,159
ain't seeing signatures like this in

797
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,559
price action, you don't have a A+

798
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,120
situation where you're buying strength.

799
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,000
Really, you're just going in there

800
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,679
buying something that is no different

801
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,919
than support resistance. You don't know

802
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,440
if this is going to come down to that

803
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,360
that low of that fair value gap and

804
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,159
bounce. In fact, I'll I'll go so far as

805
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,320
to say this. When it does that, I'm

806
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,159
admitting to you when it closes the fair

807
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,440
value gap in, I don't know. I don't know

808
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,720
if it's going to stop there and go

809
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,320
higher, which is exactly why I gave the

810
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,039
rules that I give you. I want to see it

811
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,080
not fill it. But if if I'm in a long and

812
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,360
I have a stop loss that's maybe a

813
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,720
consequent encouragement or tick below

814
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,559
it and it starts trading below the upper

815
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,799
quadrant, I'll kill that trade. Then

816
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
I'll wait for it to come down and and do

817
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,320
whatever business is going to do and

818
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,840
I'll take that loss. It's not it's not

819
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,440
it's literally just like paying an

820
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,760
insurance premium.

821
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,960
It's that's all it is is you're paying

822
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,480
an insurance premium. I'm ensuring that

823
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,159
I'm not going to sit in a larger loss,

824
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,240
but I'm protecting myself and I'm

825
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,120
guarding my mental capital and then I'll

826
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,440
wait for what I would rather see is that

827
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,279
to show me a willingness to come out of

828
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,039
that if it goes in the lower half, it

829
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,480
needs to come back out of that and then

830
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,159
give me some supporting structure in a

831
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,640
lower time frame where it does the same

832
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,559
thing here. A buy balance sell

833
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,919
efficiency that does not fill in on a

834
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,799
lower time frame. Then I'll hop back on

835
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,760
and start building my position up

836
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,679
with half the position I took as a

837
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,399
initial loss in here absorbing that

838
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,480
because maybe I got a bad read on it.

839
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,000
Maybe I was a little too overzealous or

840
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,640
whatever. But I don't ever want to be

841
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,200
buying full closure of a fair value gap.

842
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I I don't want that. I want to see them

843
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,760
stay open. And in certain respects that

844
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,200
that's why you see these nitwits on the

845
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,640
internet when I first started teaching

846
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,159
fair value gaps. They would say, "Oh,

847
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,519
look, it failed here. Look, it didn't go

848
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,960
down there. It really they don't even

849
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,120
realize that's exactly what that's the

850
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,799
best case scenario. And it just goes to

851
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,960
show you you if you listen to morons,

852
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,320
you're going to get advice.

853
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
Seriously. And there's so many morons on

854
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,760
the internet right now looking for

855
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,080
5-second fame. They just want to seem

856
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,760
like they know something. And that's

857
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,279
that's the state of affairs all around

858
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,799
the world right now. Everybody's looking

859
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,120
for some kind of validation.

860
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,000
Coming here to this community, you just

861
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,080
plug in and be a part of it. You know,

862
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,039
nobody's trying to be better than

863
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,600
anybody else. I'm not trying to be some,

864
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
you know, cult leader. I'm just hanging

865
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,320
out with you and sharing for free things

866
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,880
that I know work. And I prove it to you.

867
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,799
I prove it to you and it cost you

868
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,320
nothing. I'll tell you before it happens

869
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,040
and it it works out perfectly. What

870
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
better situation would you want? There

871
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,119
is no better situation. Okay? But if you

872
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,399
come here and you put blinders on or you

873
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,560
have selective hearing or you want to

874
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,440
teach yourself from hearing me teach and

875
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,879
you want to cherrypick certain things

876
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,240
out of, oh yeah, it makes sense to me

877
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,679
there, but I'm not going to use what he

878
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,399
said there because I don't believe that.

879
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm not telling you lies. I'm not

880
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,919
telling you things that aren't factual.

881
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,440
I'm telling you things that you can put

882
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,560
your you know,

883
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,320
let me let me hold that phrase there.

884
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,240
You can bet your bottom dollar if a demo

885
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
account quote unquote that what I'm

886
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,800
telling you is the market gospel because

887
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,919
when I say it you see it in price and

888
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,000
there's no better indication than that.

889
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,359
So when we're tape reading when I'm

890
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,960
telling you over price action watch this

891
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,480
watch that this is what's going to do

892
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,320
you want to see this when it's doing

893
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,160
that it's the same thing I'm outlining

894
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,920
here. So when we saw this u by side bell

895
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,440
side efficiency bissy fair value gap

896
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,119
this is the biggest opportunity to see

897
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,920
how much strength does gold really have

898
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,320
and this is not limited to just gold you

899
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
want to use this same concept anytime

900
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,640
you're bullish anytime you are bullish

901
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,800
on any market if there's an inefficiency

902
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,920
this visual visual in the price action

903
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,320
you want to see what's being shown here

904
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,640
an inability for price to get down there

905
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,640
you want it to saym I PT. Nah, man. You

906
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,599
don't get VIP seating today. I'm going

907
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,920
higher. That's exactly what I want.

908
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,960
That's exactly what you want. That's

909
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,640
exactly what a trader that's going long

910
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,480
or wants to be bullish on a particular

911
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,720
instrument. That's what we want to see.

912
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,040
But you and your limited understanding

913
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,200
when you come to me, you'll see that as

914
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,119
I missed a trade, it didn't give me what

915
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,160
I wanted because I wanted to buy

916
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,520
consequent encroachment or upper

917
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,640
quadrant and it starts to run away.

918
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
Well, if it's showing it on a daily

919
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,400
chart, all you have to do is drop down

920
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,720
to an hourly chart, a 15 minutes chart,

921
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,040
or anything less than, and look for

922
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
anything that's bullish at the right

923
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,640
time of day. Macro times,

924
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,920
you saw that probably in the notes, it's

925
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,040
staring you in your face right here.

926
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,280
We're covering it in a minute.

927
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
Those factors when they come together,

928
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,079
it it's just like the puzzle pieces fall

929
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,280
exactly how they should be. They

930
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,359
dovetail nicely, and then you're you're

931
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,440
on board. It doesn't mean you're going

932
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,880
to do it perfectly. You never have a

933
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,400
losing trade. I'm just saying that this

934
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,359
is what I do when I'm following a market

935
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,079
that I'm primarily bullish on. There's

936
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,920
lots of times when a market's really

937
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
really strong or really really weak, I

938
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
miss the best entry I was hoping for

939
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
because it never even gave me that

940
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,119
price. So, how can that be a matter of

941
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,960
skill? It's not a matter a matter of

942
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,119
skill not being on par. It it means that

943
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,400
if the price would have went there, I

944
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,320
would have got that fill. But the fill

945
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,240
wasn't offered to the market at all.

946
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,160
Nobody was even given that price. So

947
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,440
nobody was given upper quadrant,

948
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,320
not consequent encouragement. It just

949
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,079
went just below the high of that which

950
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,320
is this candlestick's low. So I I really

951
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,240
want to beat that in your head because a

952
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,680
lot of people were asking me, you talk

953
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,040
about gold, talk about gold, talk about

954
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,280
gold. Gold's doing nothing different

955
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,359
than any other market's doing. It's

956
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,079
following the same stuff I teach,

957
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,920
but you have to carry yourself

958
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,599
differently with this market because it

959
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,480
wants to go up. And there was a young

960
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,320
man last I think it was last uh fall or

961
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,480
the beginning of this year. Uh really

962
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,720
really young guy. He was on Twitter

963
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,079
going at everybody. He was short in

964
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,480
gold. Short in gold. Short in gold. And

965
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,839
I was like what in the world dude? Like

966
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,920
what I know he's wasted now. You

967
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,520
probably he probably deleted his channel

968
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,760
off of of social media because it

969
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,440
literally would have killed anybody.

970
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,280
Like there's no way that nobody would

971
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,119
have survived what he was trying to do

972
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,560
with even with a demo account. like

973
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,760
every every demo account that you could

974
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,440
have ever had would have been dusted and

975
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,119
destroyed. But

976
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,760
gold's doing nothing different. It it

977
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,680
still does the same things. But here's

978
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,480
the caveat to this, okay?

979
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,920
Gold is so

980
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,520
manipulated. It's so suppressed. They do

981
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,440
not let this market go to its real

982
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,200
valuation.

983
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,720
If it if it were if it really was

984
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,240
allowed to be at its real valuation,

985
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,720
it would put Bitcoin on welfare because

986
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,800
it's the world's currency. It's the

987
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,839
world's money. Gold. Gold. Only in the

988
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,400
Bible will it talks about in Revelation

989
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,520
they're going to throw gold and silver

990
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,720
in the streets because it will not save

991
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,079
them. You know, we might see that day,

992
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,680
but right now it's money. Right now it's

993
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,079
undervalued. Even after what you've seen

994
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,640
it do, it's still undervalued. Does that

995
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,960
mean it can't have vicious retracements?

996
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,560
Sure, it can have a it could have a

997
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,040
really wild retracement, but it doesn't

998
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,440
change the fact that historically you

999
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,920
looking forward from based where it came

1000
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,680
from and where it really should be on

1001
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,200
valuation.

1002
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,160
It's extremely too cheap. The problem is

1003
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,560
is can you afford to buy it at the

1004
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,240
levels you're looking at right now and

1005
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,880
weather any kind of retracement? That's

1006
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,400
that's the problem. That's what that's

1007
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,079
what we have to encounter as a trader.

1008
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,119
But anyway, when it's down here, what

1009
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,040
was the premium array that it would

1010
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
reach to if it's going to go higher?

1011
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
This high right here, since this is the

1012
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,359
highest wick compared to that one, this

1013
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,560
premium array when price is down here,

1014
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,880
if it's going to draw up to this high

1015
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,640
before it takes that high, we want to

1016
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,280
know what levels this wick offers in

1017
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
terms of grading it. So, we have the the

1018
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,359
low, which is the close of that candle,

1019
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,520
the lower quadrant. consequent

1020
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,680
encroachment midpoint upper quadrant and

1021
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,480
then the high of that wick and these

1022
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,760
levels are being shown here.

1023
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
Now watch, I'm going to give you a tip,

1024
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,760
okay? I'm going to say this and people

1025
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,960
will still watch this video and ask,

1026
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,200
"What's the benefit of knowing this?

1027
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,760
What's the benefit?" And I I I will say

1028
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,599
this part to you right now and it'll go

1029
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,560
over hundreds of people's head because

1030
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,280
you're not listening to learn. You're

1031
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,640
listening for give me a buy signal,

1032
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,920
where should my stop be, and where is it

1033
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,200
going next? That's what you were. That's

1034
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
what you're wanting me to say. And I'm

1035
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,240
trying to teach you how to read price

1036
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,160
action so that all those answers can be

1037
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,880
determined by your own experience and

1038
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,640
you'll have the comfort of picking that

1039
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
decision of participating or not

1040
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,560
participating based on your own

1041
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,119
understanding, not whatever I say. I'm

1042
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,599
not trying to tether you or any of you

1043
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,119
as students to me. Your graduation is I

1044
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,960
know enough to do this without you. I

1045
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,800
don't even watch your videos anymore.

1046
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,680
Great. That's awesome. That's exactly

1047
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,920
what I want. I want less people watching

1048
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,359
my videos because that means I'm

1049
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,760
succeeding in creating independent

1050
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,280
thinking traders. That's exactly what I

1051
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,800
want. And that is not what everybody

1052
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,400
else wants. They all want you paying

1053
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,800
them. Keep giving me ad revenue. Keep

1054
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,480
coming to my courses. Keep buying my

1055
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,599
All that stuff. It's nonsense.

1056
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,000
If you know how to trade after watching

1057
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,599
my stuff, there's no reason to come

1058
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,040
back. I'm not that interesting. I

1059
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,839
promise you. So, these levels carrying

1060
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,319
over to the right when price trades up

1061
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,599
to them. If now watch if when we trade

1062
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,520
up to premium rice down here, that's

1063
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,160
this right here. All these moves from

1064
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,680
these lows here is this

1065
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,800
just shown on a five-minute chart.

1066
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,960
That's this right here. So, if it's

1067
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,640
going to go higher, we've been bullish

1068
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,599
for a while. At least we would try to

1069
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,440
see it trade up into this high. That

1070
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,400
would be the draw in liquidity, the 481

1071
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,599
level. If that's the case, and it's a

1072
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,960
wick, we grade that. How can we know

1073
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,480
that a move like this is going to come

1074
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,920
where it just keeps surging higher? How

1075
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,200
can how can we know that's going to

1076
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,480
happen? Do you have anything that's

1077
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,079
going to teach me how to expect that?

1078
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,720
How can we anticipate these really big

1079
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,480
extrapolations in price action? How can

1080
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,560
we do that ICT? Well, what you want to

1081
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,400
do is you want to go and buy this retail

1082
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,839
book, okay? John Murphy's technical

1083
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,800
analysis of the financial markets. Okay?

1084
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
And everything in that book, you want to

1085
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,640
study it and then learn to fade it. You

1086
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,520
want to look at it and say, "This is 90%

1087
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
likely it's going to fail.

1088
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,040
and then look for instances where where

1089
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,560
they see price where it went up here

1090
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,040
like this and then turned and went

1091
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,880
lower.

1092
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,040
They're going to see that as resistance.

1093
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,280
What you want to do using my gradient

1094
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,200
levels.

1095
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,040
That's this area right in here. Okay.

1096
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,079
So, watch. I'm going to zoom in.

1097
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,119
If the market's bullish, and we're going

1098
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,760
to say for the benefit of folks that

1099
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,119
have not been with me, maybe you're

1100
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,720
watching this video, you know, months or

1101
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,400
years after it's actually being done

1102
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,680
live streamed, this area here, the

1103
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,440
market moves off that inefficiency on

1104
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
the daily chart. Then it comes back down

1105
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,119
in the order block here and then

1106
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,160
rallies. It starts moving higher until

1107
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,880
we get up into that daily wick

1108
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,839
in this vicinity right here.

1109
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,920
That's this premium wick. So in this

1110
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,920
portion of price action on this day

1111
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,240
which is yesterday's trading if we look

1112
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,520
at that like this

1113
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,119
you want to stud your eye needs to be

1114
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,400
inside this little area right here.

1115
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,359
Soon as we enter that you want to study

1116
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,880
how is price reacting when it gets to

1117
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,319
every quadrant and consequent

1118
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,839
encroachment level.

1119
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,720
Here's the tip, okay?

1120
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,440
If it can trade through the quadrant

1121
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,680
levels and it doesn't stop, like see how

1122
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,800
this right here went right to it and

1123
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,560
stopped and went lower. If you see that

1124
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,079
at anything like the consequent

1125
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,760
encroachment or the lower quadrant and

1126
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,440
there's no bodies in the upper half or

1127
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,280
above the consequent encroachment level,

1128
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
then this is probably going to have a

1129
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,680
turtle soup scenario. In other words,

1130
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,880
it's going to come back down and maybe

1131
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,000
come back into this inefficiency. Okay.

1132
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Now, here's the million-dollar concept.

1133
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,240
Okay. This this what I'm going to what

1134
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,839
I'm going to show you and tell you about

1135
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,119
right now is how ICT literally knows how

1136
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,000
to hold on to these big runners. This is

1137
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,400
what I do all the time. How did he hold

1138
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,800
on to that thousand point slide? How did

1139
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,680
he hold on to that 2500 point move here

1140
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,160
and there back in Forex days? How did I

1141
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,880
do all those things? This is it. You

1142
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,760
ready? You sitting down?

1143
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,160
Is your pen at the ready? Is your pencil

1144
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,480
sharpened? Get with an ICT. Say it. Come

1145
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,240
on. The internet might turn off.

1146
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,000
Watch

1147
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,880
the quadrant here. While we're bullish,

1148
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,280
the body was laid over top of it. And

1149
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,680
then we had this deep retracement. The

1150
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,920
only thing it went down to is this

1151
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,839
volume imbalance to that volume

1152
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,240
imbalance, which is what I just taught

1153
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,800
it to you.

1154
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,200
Suspension block. It comes down to it

1155
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,400
here and then rallies up. The bodies

1156
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,599
stop below the upper quadrant, but

1157
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,800
reference that wick. It's above this

1158
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,280
candle's high

1159
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,800
and it pierced. It's colored above the

1160
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,720
upper quadrant. So, anything like this

1161
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,079
is consolidation in here for you uh

1162
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,520
retail ricks that like to trade bull

1163
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,280
flags and be bare flags. This is when

1164
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,160
your bull flags will work because it's

1165
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,560
indicating the quadrants are being

1166
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,079
colored above. It's exploring above it.

1167
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,119
Discovery is permitted in price above

1168
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,880
the quadrants and they're not stopping

1169
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,200
price. They're coloring above them and

1170
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,440
then coming back in. They're going above

1171
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,240
them and coming back in. But if you look

1172
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,119
real real close,

1173
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,200
the quadrants are supporting it as a

1174
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,200
discount

1175
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,119
below. Look at the open on that candle

1176
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,599
there. They wick just a little bit above

1177
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,400
it here. All of this consolidation

1178
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,560
around it. Look at the bodies coalesing

1179
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,800
around that

1180
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,200
encroachment.

1181
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,119
We stop it here. Trade back down in and

1182
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,640
then boom, they let the cork out of the

1183
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,119
bottle. Bang, it's gone.

1184
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,480
And if it's doing that in a market

1185
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,160
that's really really bullish after

1186
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,520
creating something like this where we

1187
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,400
have a a big buy sell that doesn't even

1188
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,760
trade to its upper quadrant, man, you

1189
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,640
have a javelin like this thing is

1190
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,720
leaving. It's it's got someplace to go

1191
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,240
and it ain't going to wait around for

1192
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,240
you. And that's when you see it release

1193
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,640
here. And this is one of those instances

1194
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,359
where it leaves the the u

1195
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,960
the area of focus which is this premium

1196
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
wick but when it trades above it this

1197
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,440
premium wick acts as what is now at this

1198
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,680
counter rate.

1199
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,240
So the bodies are laying right on top of

1200
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,720
the high of it and then they start just

1201
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,760
letting it go higher, higher, higher,

1202
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,240
higher, higher.

1203
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,839
In your charts that I shared

1204
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,280
this morning in Telegram, uh you see me

1205
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,280
do this. This is the ICT New York open

1206
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,880
kill zone 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock in the

1207
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,440
morning for all markets. You can do all

1208
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,560
you don't need to trade London. You

1209
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,400
don't need to trade equities open. You

1210
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,760
don't need to trade a PM session. You

1211
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,520
don't need to trade Asia. You don't do

1212
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,599
any of that. You can make your entire

1213
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,200
career just with this. How can I do

1214
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,560
that? I see. That's what exactly what I

1215
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,040
want to do. Glad you asked. Swing low,

1216
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,880
market drops down, clears the buy uh

1217
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,480
clears the sell side and then leaves.

1218
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,079
What's this up here? What's this high

1219
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,319
versus this one?

1220
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,160
High probability candidate for what? A

1221
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,319
run on liquidity. So if

1222
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,560
old eyes are mine

1223
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,359
if if we have relative equal highs like

1224
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,280
this and watch the bodies. Did did we

1225
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,920
really do the business of laying a body

1226
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,960
over top of that high? This was just a

1227
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,040
small little shallow run. That means

1228
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,200
anything that was up here slightly above

1229
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,680
this wick is unfinished business.

1230
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,760
Unfinished business is a run on

1231
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,680
liquidity that was not completed. It's

1232
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,920
just a partial, just a tiny little drop

1233
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,599
down and then leave. No, no, no, no, no.

1234
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,680
They want that money. They want those

1235
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,839
orders. They want that. So, everyone

1236
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,559
that's short here that had a stop-loss

1237
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,920
and who who would be wanting to short

1238
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,119
gold? Look at freaking social media.

1239
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,280
Look at them. They're all wanting to

1240
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,200
short gold. They want me to say, "I hope

1241
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,680
gold goes down." Why?

1242
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,000
Why? Why do you want that to happen?

1243
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,680
It's a beautiful market. It's telling

1244
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,400
you, "Hello, I'm bullish." Why would you

1245
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,359
want to talk against it? Like, it's it's

1246
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,720
that that's exactly what I was doing

1247
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,800
when I was 20. Like, I wanted all the

1248
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,440
markets I was focusing on to be dis, you

1249
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,920
know, not when I first started, but when

1250
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,359
I first started shorting because I

1251
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,200
wasn't a bear for a number of years. I

1252
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,960
didn't understand shorting. But when I

1253
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,400
first figured out how to short, I

1254
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,680
thought everything was going to drop.

1255
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,119
every time I saw a bearish diverg like,

1256
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,480
"Okay, now I understand how it works."

1257
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,079
So, I wanted everything and I hated when

1258
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,440
people talk good about something and I

1259
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,359
was looking to go short. And that's a

1260
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,200
sign of infancy. Like, you're you're

1261
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,760
really you're not equipped. You don't

1262
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,520
know what you're doing. If if anything I

1263
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,119
say or anyone else says about a market

1264
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,800
that you hope goes one way or the other

1265
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,960
and you lose your mind over that, just

1266
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,559
get off of social media because you're

1267
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,079
not properly equipped to be a trader and

1268
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,280
you're not really in a right state of

1269
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,440
mind to be engaging and having any kind

1270
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,760
of discourse with other people because a

1271
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,319
real trader doesn't give two shits what

1272
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,680
the other person thinks about their

1273
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,359
market or their trade, how much they

1274
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,119
make, how much they didn't make. We

1275
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,079
don't care. We don't care. Nobody cares

1276
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,680
what anybody else is doing when you're

1277
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,760
successful. Now, I like seeing other

1278
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,839
people successful, but that's a

1279
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,000
hindrance for someone that's developing.

1280
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,920
But if you have a buy side liquidity

1281
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,760
pool that's framed properly as I give

1282
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,880
you, this is the right high needs to be

1283
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,040
lower than the high to the left of it.

1284
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,319
And when it's a buy side balance sign,

1285
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,119
I'm sorry, buy side liquidity pool. See,

1286
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,000
that would have been an edit point right

1287
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,079
there. I would usually hit control and

1288
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,599
then M. And that would create a little

1289
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,119
marker for my timeline and I'd go back

1290
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,800
and listen for that part and I'd clean

1291
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,359
it up. Well, I'm out here with a no

1292
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,960
safety net. So, everything I mess up and

1293
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,640
say, it's it's there and I can't erase

1294
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,599
it. Kind of like Twitter. But a low and

1295
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,280
a higher low to the right of it, that

1296
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,839
would be a candidate for what? It's a

1297
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,520
high probability candidate for sellside

1298
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,480
liquidity pool being purged. But if the

1299
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,319
market's bullish, you don't look at that

1300
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,359
like that. But if the market's bullish

1301
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,520
and it's left this, you want to see

1302
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,640
bodies plunge its way up into that. But

1303
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,359
look, they've only did what? the wick

1304
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,160
and then it drops down and there's

1305
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,760
people out there, you know, looking at u

1306
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,200
ICU candlestick method. You try to trade

1307
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,079
with this garbage, you're going to end

1308
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,319
up in intensive care unit trying to

1309
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,359
trade with that trash. The you know what

1310
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,520
I'm talking about. The market did not

1311
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,000
leave a body up there. So, it's dropping

1312
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,359
down. So, they're going to see that as

1313
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,520
oh, it's a short and the only thing it's

1314
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,839
doing is dropping down into a discount

1315
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,240
array.

1316
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,640
order block

1317
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,079
rallies up

1318
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,680
clears it and leaves the body right

1319
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,000
there. That's officially running the

1320
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,200
liquidity here. But if we look at it on

1321
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,960
a one minute chart, which if I do that

1322
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,640
then I have to toggle move on. Just do

1323
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,000
look at this area right here. Look at

1324
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,680
your uh your five-minute chart at 8:15

1325
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,200
a.m. Look at on a one minute chart and

1326
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,520
you'll see what that rectangle is there.

1327
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,040
But it rallies up and that that right

1328
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
there, this run from here to here,

1329
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,559
that's all your model needs to be and

1330
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,200
you don't need a job.

1331
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,680
Let me say it again slower. If you know

1332
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,640
how to frame this setup, which is

1333
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,800
something I taught in high probability

1334
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,040
short-term trading and scalping, it's

1335
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,040
it's a it's a couple videos. You don't

1336
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,640
even need to spend that much time doing

1337
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,520
anything with it, but then studying it.

1338
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,440
These setups appear every single day.

1339
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,720
Every single day. every single trading

1340
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,720
day. This appears every day and it

1341
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,720
occurs every single New York open kill

1342
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,720
zone. It may not be a long, it may be a

1343
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,640
short, but it's always there. You need

1344
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,720
to know where the draw and liquidity is.

1345
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,559
How can I do that? Give me a bias. Tell

1346
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,160
me how. You seem like you're very giving

1347
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,319
today. Well, if you're bullish because

1348
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,480
you have something like this, seeing a

1349
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,640
situation like this, this is a loaded

1350
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,720
deal. Easy. Like it's no B. It's a

1351
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,280
no-brainer. Or as Larry Williams would

1352
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,480
say in his 70s book, this is a lead pipe

1353
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,800
sense trade.

1354
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,319
The first time I saw that in this book,

1355
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,160
I'm like, what does that even mean?

1356
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,520
Like, what does that mean? What's a lead

1357
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,760
pipe? It's so easy. It's like taking a a

1358
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,920
lead pipe and smashing it in the head.

1359
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,440
Like, there's no there's no defense

1360
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,760
against it. It's easy. It's like

1361
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,440
bringing a gun to a uh a rubber band uh

1362
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,119
matchup. like you're going to fight

1363
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,240
somebody, but they're going to sting you

1364
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,400
with a rubber band and you got a Glock,

1365
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,760
you know, fully loaded with hollow

1366
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,680
point. Who's going to win that? It's

1367
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,520
obvious, right? It's so outmatched.

1368
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,440
Well, in my pursuit of finding the best

1369
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,559
of setups and framing it, that's why my

1370
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,559
stuff is so good because I've spent my

1371
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,559
entire life looking for that stuff. I

1372
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,720
filtered out all the BS. I filtered out

1373
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,720
everything that does not work. If it

1374
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,319
doesn't have a degree of precision

1375
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,720
element behind it, if there's any kind

1376
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,040
of ambiguity, it is not in my

1377
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,800
repertoire, it is not being taught by

1378
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,079
me, it is not being any no emphasis is

1379
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,559
placed on that. And that is many times

1380
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,559
what makes me offensive to most people

1381
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,480
because they believe in their religion

1382
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,079
of what they think their indicators

1383
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,000
their their hero that they taught him or

1384
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,520
maybe he's passed on and he's moved on

1385
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,440
in the afterlife. But they they

1386
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,480
subscribe to these views when what I

1387
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,960
teach and I show and I can do and my

1388
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,599
students do. We rip the out of

1389
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,200
everything. There's nothing out there

1390
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,960
like this. There's nothing literally

1391
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,280
nothing like this.

1392
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,800
And it's impatience on the students part

1393
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,000
when they come here because they want it

1394
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,440
to be easy and they want it to be fast

1395
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,880
and they don't like when I talk like

1396
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,319
this. But this is how you get that

1397
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,280
understanding. You have to know why

1398
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,720
you're looking at this. What's the

1399
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,760
benefit? How should I look at it? When

1400
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,000
should I expect it? Notice I'm teaching

1401
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,559
you time. I'm always talking about time.

1402
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,240
Notice I'm also talking about psychology

1403
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,680
and the right way of thinking about it.

1404
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,480
Every time I talk, I'm doing that.

1405
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,720
But you're looking for buzzwords. And

1406
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,240
you're looking for how you think you

1407
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,240
should learn. And that's someone that's

1408
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,040
a self-taught mentality. And you can go

1409
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,160
out there and try to teach yourself

1410
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,760
trading, but you're going to come back

1411
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,160
to me because you didn't learn well. You

1412
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,520
won't be able to teach yourself. How you

1413
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,880
going to teach somebody when you're

1414
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,400
ignorant? And if there's somebody you're

1415
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,480
trying to teach as yourself,

1416
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,040
you're you're literally saying that your

1417
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,839
ego is telling you that you know enough

1418
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,000
to know how you should be taught. Then

1419
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,520
then don't watch me. Don't watch

1420
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,839
anybody. But no one's going to give you

1421
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,319
the skinny like this. They may give an

1422
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,359
opinion, but I'm telling you before the

1423
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,280
fact. And all you have to do is watch

1424
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,839
how I do it on Twitter, and I tell you

1425
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,359
exactly what's going to happen, and it

1426
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,640
does it. Now, I'm not promising you that

1427
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,839
I'm going to do it every time, every

1428
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,079
day. I don't do that. When I feel

1429
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,200
inspired to do it, then I'll do it. If

1430
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,359
it's so overwhelmingly obvious, then

1431
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,240
I'll do it. When it's really, really,

1432
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,520
really likely that I know that if I say

1433
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,280
something,

1434
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,480
most of you are probably doing what I

1435
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,760
tell you not to do, which is trade. And

1436
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,839
then you tell me, "Look at I made ICT.

1437
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,680
Thank you so much." I don't want you

1438
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,400
doing that. That's why I don't do it

1439
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,319
every day. That's why I don't live

1440
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,160
stream and tell you exactly what's going

1441
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,400
to happen because that gets in my head.

1442
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,720
I don't want to incur risk for you

1443
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,839
because I know you're not going to

1444
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,599
listen to me. You're going to see me

1445
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:12,960
talk about something that's bullish and

1446
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,400
you're going to overlever your account

1447
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,880
and you will not

1448
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,799
have the wherewithal to stay with the

1449
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,960
idea where if I was doing the trade, I

1450
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,760
probably wouldn't have that many

1451
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,920
contracts on. I would have a stop-loss

1452
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,240
on. And you don't have that experience.

1453
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,000
So, you're gonna hurt yourself and then

1454
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,440
you're gonna send me in a sock puppet

1455
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,760
account or in emails. Threats in my life

1456
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,799
and you're going to do this and you're

1457
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,000
gonna do that and I'm gonna tell you,

1458
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,440
"Come over here right now, and I

1459
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,119
will kick your ass and blow your ass

1460
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,799
away." There it is. I You get threats

1461
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,160
all the time from these crazy people on

1462
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,839
the internet. It's how it is. That's how

1463
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:47,040
it is all the time. So, to protect your

1464
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,680
sanity and my time, I manage everybody's

1465
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,760
expectation at what level I'm

1466
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,720
comfortable with. So when I tell you the

1467
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,079
market's going to respect this level

1468
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,079
here. Watch this right here. Focus right

1469
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,480
here. And then here is the opposing

1470
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,359
side. This is where it's going to go to

1471
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,839
after it does that. That's the

1472
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,319
framework. That's how I teach. Now

1473
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,799
everybody else

1474
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,720
that doesn't like me or I'm killing

1475
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,119
their business, they'll come at me and

1476
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,559
say, "He didn't tell you to get in. He

1477
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,839
didn't give you a stop-loss. He's not

1478
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,680
doing anything." But you don't even see

1479
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,599
them doing that consistently. And I'm

1480
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:24,720
telling you, if you're worried about

1481
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,079
that type of stuff or the opinions of

1482
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,319
others, that's going to be a a detriment

1483
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,319
to your development. It literally will

1484
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,640
be a detriment to your development. So

1485
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,079
having realistic expectations,

1486
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,839
having no money on the line, that's how

1487
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,079
you learn. Anybody that tells you you

1488
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,599
have to put some money on the line to

1489
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,240
learn this is an absolute ass clown.

1490
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,680
They don't know what they're talking

1491
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,839
about. They are literally just trying to

1492
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,920
sound like Billy Bigballs. And I'm

1493
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,720
telling you, nobody gets this level of

1494
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,040
understanding and comfort by risking

1495
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,400
money in the beginning because you're

1496
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,760
you're you're imposing the complication

1497
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,720
of right or wrong as an outcome filter.

1498
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,000
You're not going to walk away from the

1499
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,680
development aspect that's available to

1500
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,960
you. If if you're worried about whether

1501
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,000
you're going to be right or wrong on the

1502
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,440
outcome, and that's because you're

1503
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,240
putting money on it. You have to be

1504
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,839
bored out of your mind because you do

1505
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,680
this so many times. You've done it so

1506
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,280
many times. You do it all the time,

1507
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,880
every single week. It's same process.

1508
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,119
Routine, routine, routine. And looking

1509
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,280
for this type of framework here. This is

1510
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,200
an easy breadandbut model that everybody

1511
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,280
can do. But see, when you see this and

1512
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,400
it goes right here and that's the end of

1513
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,520
the trade, you look at all this and

1514
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,200
you're thinking, "This is a stupid

1515
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,960
model. Look at all the money I left on

1516
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,520
the table." not realizing that you

1517
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,319
didn't hear what I said. This model here

1518
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,040
is an everyday model. Just like your

1519
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,280
job, when you go to work, you know, when

1520
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,079
you sit your ass down, give that person

1521
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,240
that is now enslaved you and you

1522
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,160
prostituted your life and time to them,

1523
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,000
you gave up time from your family. When

1524
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,160
you've done that, you know if you submit

1525
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,760
yourself to that amount of time and you

1526
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,119
punched the clock at the right time and

1527
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,880
got there earlier or got on time and you

1528
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,160
punched it out when it's time for you to

1529
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,920
go home, you know you just now logged in

1530
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,960
X amount of dollars for your time. Okay,

1531
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,040
just as good as that's going to show up,

1532
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,480
that's what these do every day. These

1533
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,559
setups form every single day. That same

1534
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,119
level of continuity and consistency, you

1535
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,640
can expect that formation in price

1536
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,760
action. 99.999999%

1537
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,720
of everybody in retail, everybody in

1538
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,119
retail, they don't have that confidence

1539
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,240
because they don't know what the hell

1540
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,920
they're looking for. They're

1541
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,880
reactionary. They react to price. I am

1542
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
not reacting to price. None of my

1543
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,960
students are reacting to price. We are

1544
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,640
react reacting to everybody else's

1545
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,319
opinion of what we're doing because they

1546
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,000
think they know us and they have no idea

1547
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,680
what we're doing or who we are. We

1548
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,400
literally own this show. We own it.

1549
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Look at Look at what my students Oh,

1550
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,319
forget what I do. Forget it. Okay,

1551
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,920
forget it. And yes, I'm on my high horse

1552
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,280
because I don't give a whether this

1553
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,720
pisses you off or not. I got to get it

1554
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,200
off my chest. I was driving in a car

1555
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,599
cramped up. Okay, I got to let my legs

1556
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,240
run a little bit here.

1557
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,559
My students,

1558
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,160
people that have sat down and said, "You

1559
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,119
know what? There's a lot of things said

1560
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,200
about this man."

1561
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,760
And I could waste my time listening to

1562
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,839
that or I can just take the evidence

1563
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,160
that's presented to me and wait in my

1564
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,440
own hands. If it's Photoshop, then it

1565
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,280
can't be Photoshop if I tell you before

1566
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,000
it happens and over 720,000 of you watch

1567
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,960
it happen in your charts live.

1568
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,480
How many times have I come out here and

1569
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,440
got it wrong? Give me two times where I

1570
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,280
ever did that. You can't find it. You

1571
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,119
can't find it. And nothing ever gets

1572
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,119
deleted.

1573
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,119
Nothing never gets deleted. And now,

1574
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,760
see, you watch me because I'm the oneman

1575
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,559
show. But I have so many students out

1576
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,280
there that are doing it, too. They're

1577
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,720
doing it, too. And they are growing.

1578
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,160
They're going to become pillars in this

1579
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,319
community. Not my personal community,

1580
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,799
but the community as a trading industry.

1581
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,200
They will be pillars.

1582
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,040
And the way you look at me, you will

1583
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,960
look at them in the future, too, because

1584
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,359
they're learning how to manage themsel.

1585
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,960
They know what they're looking for and

1586
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,040
they don't care what ICT is doing. They

1587
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,480
don't care what new thing ICT is

1588
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,200
teaching. They have found their way and

1589
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,680
they have said, you know what?

1590
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,599
Yes, he might be teaching new stuff.

1591
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,200
Yes, it might be great. It might be

1592
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,640
highly precise and he may be able to do

1593
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,599
this, that, and the other thing. Back

1594
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,200
flips and flames shoot out of his ass.

1595
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,359
But the bottom line is this. I am making

1596
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,880
money with what I've learned and I don't

1597
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,799
need to do anything else. I'm

1598
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,240
comfortable and I'm content. And that's

1599
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,680
why I teach and I've said it at the

1600
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,160
beginning in baby pips days. Learn to be

1601
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,240
content.

1602
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,480
That is something future and it's also

1603
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,119
something current all the time. Whatever

1604
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,480
your progress you have right now while

1605
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,319
learning under me, whatever that is at

1606
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,000
this moment, be content with that

1607
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,280
because you're learning at the right

1608
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,880
pace. Even if you don't think you are,

1609
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,319
you are learning at the right pace.

1610
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:07,920
You want to be able to go out there and

1611
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,119
get 500 handles, thousand handles. You

1612
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,559
want to buy and sell. Buy and sell. Buy

1613
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,240
and sell. Go directions. O all over the

1614
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,000
place. You want to do all those things.

1615
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,240
But what you don't realize is I am not

1616
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,119
doing that every day. I'm not doing that

1617
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,000
every day. I'm living my life. I'm doing

1618
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,680
whatever I want to do. And then when I

1619
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,640
feel like I want to sit in front of the

1620
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,000
charts, I know if I sit down in front of

1621
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,440
the charts, I know I'm going to find

1622
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,440
something.

1623
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,440
And to prove it's not contrived or made

1624
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,160
up or cherrypicked or photoshopped.

1625
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,599
Gambler. The bottom line is this. I put

1626
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,240
it out there in the ether, one-sided,

1627
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,559
clear, to the point, levels defined, and

1628
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,920
we all watch on a short leash. It gets

1629
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:56,040
walked like a dog. Now, I could

1630
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,839
I could be that 20-year-old me. Could.

1631
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:04,880
And I could grind all of you little ass

1632
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,160
hats on a daily basis and you would

1633
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,960
really hate me. But I don't need to do

1634
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,520
that. I don't even need to. I do this

1635
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,039
part-time and I'm killing all these

1636
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,440
other guys. So the bottom line is this.

1637
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,839
You have to subscribe to whatever

1638
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,760
starting point you want to reach for

1639
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,039
that's realistic. If it's silver bullet

1640
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,480
that model, which is very simple, it's

1641
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,720
time based. You're only looking at one

1642
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,039
hour of time. You're waiting for 10

1643
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,240
o'clock in the morning, Eastern time,

1644
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,520
and you're waiting for this type of

1645
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,720
scenario here. I got to I got to put it

1646
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,839
on a one minute chart. It's driving me

1647
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:39,359
nuts. The idea of simply waiting for one

1648
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:42,240
setup, one little framework of of of

1649
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,039
price action within a defined range of

1650
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,039
time, very very specific element of

1651
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,039
price action that is limited to just

1652
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,319
one specific thing. See how even the

1653
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:55,520
candlesticks on the one minute chart

1654
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,680
didn't lay over top the high. So this is

1655
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,319
that that this is that uh buy side

1656
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,520
balance sell efficiency on one minute

1657
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,720
chart. So unfinished business in your

1658
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,640
notes anytime at liquidity pool when

1659
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,319
it's bullish if buy side's been taken

1660
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,799
but nobody's been left above it it's

1661
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,400
unfinished

1662
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,880
expected to come back for it again. That

1663
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,119
right there folks that right there and

1664
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,559
what I taught you about when to

1665
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,000
anticipate the run through when it's

1666
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,839
aggressive and it's going to just

1667
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:25,680
explode up using the the quadrants.

1668
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,920
That right there is worth more than I

1669
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,079
charge for mentorship.

1670
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,920
And I am not bullshitting you. That is

1671
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,599
the bee's knees, man. I'm telling you,

1672
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,599
if you understand that, you go back in

1673
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,599
your charts and look at it, study it,

1674
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,280
collect that type of information every

1675
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,920
single week. Really build an evidence

1676
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,240
log of these things happening and you

1677
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,079
will see what I just gave you is the

1678
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,440
absolute undeniable facts.

1679
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,480
It never deviates. It never fails. That

1680
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,640
stuff is always a constant. And that

1681
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,480
right there also tells you that these

1682
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,240
markets are algorithmic. It's an

1683
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,400
algorithm. It is literally doing Listen,

1684
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,240
if it was all buy and selling pressure,

1685
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,000
if it was all buy and selling pressure

1686
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,640
would not agree with every PD array that

1687
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,720
I've ever created.

1688
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,799
It wouldn't agree.

1689
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,000
They would not be dancing on the rhythm

1690
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,839
and the stepping stones that my PD

1691
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,720
arrays give it.

1692
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,119
But the the only deviations are the

1693
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,280
inefficiencies don't get fully closed

1694
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,640
in. And that's exactly what I'm looking

1695
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,000
for. And that's exactly what I'm

1696
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,559
teaching you to look for.

1697
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,319
How's that failure?

1698
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,960
It's not. It's perfection.

1699
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,799
It's scary, isn't it? It's almost like

1700
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,880
it should be illegal.

1701
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,039
How much time is going to keep going on?

1702
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,280
This guy keeps getting it right. He's

1703
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,760
creating too many freaking millionaires.

1704
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,119
He's creating monsters.

1705
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,839
Why is he yelling?

1706
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,520
Because you're bored listening to me

1707
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,920
rant. You're not teaching, dude. You're

1708
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,480
so annoying. Get up the road. I ain't

1709
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,160
got time for somebody like you. You're

1710
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,599
too close-minded. If you don't want to

1711
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,200
jump in the plasma pool, get out of

1712
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,119
here. Okay. See you later.

1713
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,680
So anyway, this is the pattern. This is

1714
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,680
an all day, every day. It's going to be

1715
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,920
there 365 days. If the market was open

1716
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,119
that many times, you'd see it every day.

1717
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,559
you would see it every day.

1718
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,960
Why wouldn't you want to explore that?

1719
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,160
Why wouldn't you want to take that

1720
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,880
challenge and see if it really does

1721
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,079
exist every day?

1722
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,200
Some of you might want to take that

1723
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,119
challenge and some of you might grow in

1724
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,240
your understanding just by doing that

1725
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,160
alone. That's how I get you. I get you

1726
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,319
just like that. I put it out there and

1727
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,599
you don't want to believe it and you

1728
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,240
want to find me as a liar, a fraud, a

1729
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,359
scammer and then you can't and you send

1730
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,640
me an email. Man, listen dude. I just

1731
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,400
made this much money doing what I

1732
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,599
thought that you were talking on your

1733
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,119
ass and it wasn't. Couldn't be true.

1734
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,039
Couldn't be true. I was convinced it was

1735
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,880
Photoshop because somebody said it was

1736
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,720
Photoshop because they can't do it.

1737
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,559
Because they can't do it. It's too good

1738
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,319
for them. And then guess what? Guess

1739
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,599
what, Vegas? That's a compliment, baby.

1740
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,280
Thank you. Thank you. Keep chilling

1741
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,520
those codes to get that money,

1742
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,440
boy. Because I ain't got to do none of

1743
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,920
that stuff. I ain't got to do none of

1744
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,520
that.

1745
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,839
I know you heard me.

1746
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,880
I know you heard me.

1747
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,039
It's all compliments.

1748
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,880
Anything they said about me or my stuff,

1749
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,319
it's always a compliment because if they

1750
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,920
say they don't believe it, it's too good

1751
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,520
to be true. And I tell you, that's how

1752
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,839
it's going to be.

1753
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,640
When it's in your own hands,

1754
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,079
your friends and your co-workers are not

1755
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,440
going to understand the bounce in your

1756
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,640
step. When you're walking

1757
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,240
through knowing that your time here is

1758
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,680
going to be short and sweet and you're

1759
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,520
going on the road, you got you're going

1760
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,400
places. You're not staying at that job.

1761
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,680
You're not staying there. That's not

1762
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,799
where you're supposed to be. But that's

1763
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,559
a right now need. You have to pay your

1764
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,559
bills. That has to happen. But when you

1765
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,039
know that this is in your hands and you

1766
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,200
can make it work and you see it working

1767
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,359
daily,

1768
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,880
man, there's a spring. There's a bounce

1769
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,040
in that step. There's a rhythm in your

1770
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,199
stride and you start strutting. You got

1771
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,400
to check yourself once in a while.

1772
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,600
You're walking to the cafeteria. It's

1773
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,960
lunch time and all of a sudden you're

1774
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,880
swaying. You're bouncing. Oh my

1775
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,719
goodness. I know I ain't gonna be here

1776
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:32,719
much longer. This guy, look at this guy

1777
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:34,080
over here. He's looking at me, giving me

1778
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,080
that look like, "Yeah, yeah, you're

1779
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,279
gonna be here just like me." The rest

1780
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,239
are like, "No, I'm not. You don't know

1781
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,159
what I see. You don't know what I'm

1782
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,920
doing behind the curtain. You have no

1783
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,759
idea what I just did in the

1784
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,600
marketplace." And that's just one of

1785
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,279
many things that's going to repeat and

1786
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,719
I'm going to bounce my ass out of this

1787
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,279
job. I ain't got to be here. You all

1788
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,839
have to be here, but I ain't got to be

1789
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,880
here. I'm here by choice. I'm here by

1790
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,040
schedule only. And the schedule's about

1791
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,040
time to change. and my ass is floating

1792
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,960
up on out of here to Easy Street. And

1793
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,359
ain't nobody hold me back. None of these

1794
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,120
people hold me back. Your paycheck's a

1795
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,960
offense to me. I don't ever want

1796
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,319
to see that little bit of money ever

1797
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,839
again in my life. And I don't have to

1798
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,759
because I can cut my own paycheck. I

1799
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,600
could do this anytime I want. That's

1800
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,359
what's going to happen to you. That's

1801
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,880
what's going to happen to you. And the

1802
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,640
weaker side of you, the weaker side,

1803
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,080
will let it bleed into social media.

1804
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,279
And that's your mistake.

1805
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,960
Then it becomes counting pockets

1806
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,239
and not precision, consistency, and

1807
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:41,120
wealthb buildinging legacy.

1808
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,279
That's the trap.

1809
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,080
That's the trap.

1810
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,279
And if you can control yourself and mind

1811
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,880
your own damn business and keep

1812
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,080
everybody out of your business,

1813
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,239
you have a greater chance of succeeding.

1814
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,080
But if you don't do that, and it's hard,

1815
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,239
folks. It's hard. It's really, really

1816
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,560
hard because when you start seeing

1817
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,360
things happen for you.

1818
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,480
It's hard to sleep.

1819
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,120
It's hard to think about anything else.

1820
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,920
Your job is affected. Your relationship

1821
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,880
is affected. Your parenting is affected.

1822
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,840
Your health could be affected.

1823
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,360
And if you get really excited and you

1824
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,800
can't sleep because you just can't stop,

1825
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,080
think about the opportunities that you

1826
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,640
now have control over. And yes, I said

1827
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,000
that right. You have control. You don't

1828
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,840
have to get in here every single day,

1829
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,199
but the model's going to appear every

1830
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,560
single day. Find that in any retail

1831
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,120
logic. It's not there.

1832
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,360
It's not there. But they got every

1833
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,360
excuse to tell you why. Well, you know,

1834
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,640
the market's random. That's why, you

1835
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,640
know,

1836
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,960
that is some nonsense. And I love it

1837
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:04,159
because that stuff is who you eat.

1838
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,000
That's what's on the menu. Retail.

1839
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,080
Retail. The other white meat. Remember

1840
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,440
that ad? Pork the other white meat.

1841
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,320
Yeah, that's what it is. We're all

1842
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,440
carnivores. Nobody's a vegan trader. You

1843
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,800
either are eating or you're eating.

1844
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,640
That's the way it is. There's no vegans

1845
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,880
here.

1846
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:37,679
No vegans. You must consume and eat. And

1847
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,760
unless you have a way to hunt, stalk,

1848
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,800
and eat,

1849
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,199
you're the prey.

1850
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,679
You're the one consumed. You are the

1851
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,880
mark. You're the liquidity.

1852
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,719
And if you can't find the liquidity in

1853
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,560
that chart

1854
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,719
tag, you're it.

1855
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,280
And that's for every market. That's for

1856
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,480
everything out there that you trade.

1857
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,960
I don't care about whatever willy

1858
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,920
vanilly pattern, whatever the horseshit

1859
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,920
that you out there believe makes these

1860
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,640
park markets go up and down.

1861
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,480
you are going to fall victim if that's

1862
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,239
not true in your own hands, in your own

1863
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,679
model, your way of thinking. If you're

1864
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,480
not thinking that way,

1865
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,960
you're not equipped.

1866
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,120
There's there's no Mr. Rogers approach

1867
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,040
to this, folks, there really isn't.

1868
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,920
There really isn't. And as much as I

1869
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,000
tried my life to come up with a way

1870
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,320
where it could be just very uh

1871
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,320
civilized.

1872
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,120
Losing money makes you realize it's not

1873
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,080
civilized. It's war.

1874
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,000
It's carnivorous.

1875
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,800
It's brutal.

1876
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,880
Guess what? You need to see it that way

1877
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,480
because until you do, you're not going

1878
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,560
to respect the risk. You will not

1879
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,760
respect the risk.

1880
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,840
So anyway,

1881
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,120
let's go back to five minute chart real

1882
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,400
quick and get this part over here

1883
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,840
because I got one more market to talk

1884
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,159
about and then I got a scadattlele.

1885
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:15,960
So the uh

1886
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,880
the market

1887
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,800
uh uses the uh

1888
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,280
macro time here

1889
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,800
right there. And if I'm not mistaken, I

1890
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,920
had it on the one minute chart when I

1891
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,000
put it on there. I guess. Yeah, there it

1892
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,600
is. Equities real time regular trying

1893
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,640
I'm sorry, regular trading hours.

1894
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,040
That's this right here. If you are a

1895
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,360
gold trader, okay, and you don't put

1896
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,520
this information on your chart, uh

1897
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,719
you're you're trading blind

1898
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,400
and it's information that you need to

1899
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,360
have. Okay. Uh there's there's several

1900
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,880
opening prices that I think you should

1901
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,400
have. This is this is the part when you

1902
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,679
grab your pen and write down. Put the

1903
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,080
Doritos down. Grab your pen and write

1904
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,520
this down. Every midnight opening price,

1905
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,480
Eastern time, whatever asset you trade,

1906
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,719
you need to know that price. You need to

1907
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,800
know the 9:30 regular trading hours

1908
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,880
opening price when the opening bell for

1909
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,120
the stock market starts. Uh that's this

1910
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,880
one here. So, it's 9:30 in the morning

1911
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,960
Eastern time.

1912
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,719
And just, you know,

1913
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:27,040
label whatever you want to label it. Uh

1914
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,440
if you want to keep a a worksheet or

1915
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,760
workspace in your charts that you just

1916
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,520
want to have these only on a chart,

1917
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,199
that's the best way of of organizing

1918
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,239
these types of things. Um like opening

1919
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,800
prices just like that and then put your

1920
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,719
date on it.

1921
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,080
I have all this stuff in a notepad. The

1922
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,400
the question I get a lot is, can you

1923
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,520
just show us your notepad?

1924
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,120
It's the things I showed you in a chart

1925
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,320
today. I just have those in a numerical

1926
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,719
list from the highest price down to the

1927
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,640
lowest price and I just write down in

1928
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,520
shorthand what they are to me and I what

1929
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,360
one I think by my own experience is

1930
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,040
going to get tagged. That's it. That's

1931
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,120
all that's all that's all it is. I

1932
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,120
promise you there's no secret formulas.

1933
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,320
There's no uh expressions in algebra,

1934
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,520
you know, coming up with some kind of

1935
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,960
calculus, you know, result of here it is

1936
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,199
trigonometry and uh you know, all higher

1937
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,120
forms of math suggest that this is the

1938
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,719
price high and low. It's not that's not

1939
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,440
what it is. It's every one of these wick

1940
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,360
prices

1941
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,760
and their specific quadrants. That's all

1942
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,760
I'm writing down, folks. That's all it

1943
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,640
is. I promise you there's nothing else

1944
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,719
on there but a doodle. Sometimes I'll

1945
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,320
draw, you know, and and that's it.

1946
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,880
That's all I'm doing. I don't look at a

1947
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,640
chart with lines on it unless I'm

1948
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,199
teaching you. I like looking at the

1949
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,600
chart naked with no lines because it

1950
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,800
allows my subconscious to pick up on new

1951
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,080
information. In the beginning, it's

1952
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,320
advantageous for you to put these levels

1953
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,719
on your chart, but I also know your

1954
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,080
concern for having too many things on

1955
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,159
your chart is

1956
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:08,400
it's it's it's

1957
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,600
Well, it's a real argument to consider,

1958
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,640
but the way you balance it is on Trading

1959
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,360
View, you can just create a workspace

1960
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,520
and you want to have like your openings

1961
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,239
at 9:30 Eastern time and then then date

1962
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,840
them.

1963
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,920
Don't worry about how far back you got

1964
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,520
to do because it's easy to go into the

1965
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,360
the object tree and then turn off the

1966
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,679
ones that's gone past a month or so.

1967
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,600
Okay, you're going to tell me that you

1968
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,560
got to have 20. Yeah, 20 is good.

1969
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,159
You're going to see a lot of things by

1970
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,640
having 20 days worth of regular trading

1971
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,159
hours opening prices on your charts.

1972
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,440
You're going to see you never seen

1973
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,840
before. You're going to like, "What in

1974
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,280
the world? That was there. All that."

1975
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,360
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Midnight Eastern time,

1976
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,719
9:30 in the morning, 6 o'clock reopen

1977
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,480
time,

1978
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,600
all assets. Yeah. But Forex, I didn't

1979
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,280
say anything about that. I said this is

1980
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,760
the time you have on your chart. five

1981
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,280
o'clock PM and 4:14 PM Eastern time.

1982
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,000
Okay, that's enough for right now. You

1983
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,239
don't need anymore.

1984
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,520
That alone will start giving you X-ray

1985
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,040
view of price moves that you've never

1986
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,760
seen before. They're there. And the

1987
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,440
model I just outlined here, that little

1988
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,080
simple little cracker jack of a, you

1989
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,679
know, model where it's just simple

1990
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,400
unfinished business,

1991
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,199
it repeats every single day off of one

1992
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:36,640
of those opening prices, too.

1993
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,719
Oh no, he just did it again. He just

1994
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,480
gave away Yeah, I did. Wait till you

1995
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,280
Wait till you get the books.

1996
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,719
What in the world? The candy store. I go

1997
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,040
into next. Yep. That's what it's gonna

1998
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,280
be like. It's gonna be like just like

1999
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,000
that. So good.

2000
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,400
So good.

2001
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,040
Can't wait. But anyway,

2002
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,040
here's the equities opening price here

2003
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,400
and it trades down to that and you get

2004
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,960
that run here. But then

2005
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,360
let's scrunch it up. Can you tell I'm

2006
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,480
having fun? I miss talking to you guys.

2007
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,800
My wife's not here so I can really cut

2008
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,400
up with you. She usually she'll give me

2009
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,080
the hairy eye if I'm like that. she's in

2010
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,920
in the anywhere in the house, she'll

2011
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,520
come around and she'll be like, "Is that

2012
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,080
necessary?" I'm like,

2013
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,400
"It's ICT necessary." It is. It's it's

2014
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,640
it's definitely necessary. Yeah, it has

2015
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,040
to be done. But we see it trade down

2016
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,960
into the macro of 2:50 p.m. 3:10 Eastern

2017
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,080
time. Now, let's let's zoom in here

2018
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,679
because I really want you to see

2019
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,560
this candlestick comes in at 3:08. So, 8

2020
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,280
minutes after 3:00 Eastern time. Um, but

2021
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,440
this is gold and it's the last trading

2022
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,600
hour of equities, right? For regular

2023
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,960
trading hours, gold's going to behave

2024
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,520
just like this when it's animated.

2025
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,120
Now,

2026
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,280
normally when there hasn't been so much

2027
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,480
fever around gold, you wouldn't see big

2028
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,920
runs like this, but you would get some

2029
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,280
kind of a little setup that can be

2030
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,600
traded on a 15-second, 30 second, one

2031
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,800
minute chart, five minute chart, that

2032
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,199
type of deal. But don't expect like big

2033
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,199
big huge payouts. But because it's so

2034
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,239
animated right now, because it's so

2035
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,080
like energetic, it's trying to get

2036
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,159
somewhere and it's moving a lot, you're

2037
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,679
going to get these really nice responses

2038
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,120
like that. Like I mean, look at that.

2039
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,600
That's a beautiful response. What do you

2040
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,360
think that is right there? What is that?

2041
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,960
That's that what high probability

2042
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,040
candidate for a run on liquidity.

2043
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,880
Here's an inefficiency. We trade down

2044
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,400
into it. Can it get to consequent

2045
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,719
crochet? Well, you can see it without

2046
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,520
having any fib on it.

2047
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,040
There's the halfway. Here's quadrant

2048
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,080
upper. Did it touch it? Nope. And it's

2049
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,080
rallying

2050
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,640
this easy draw.

2051
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,760
Hits it.

2052
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,280
Not yet. Right

2053
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,280
there.

2054
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,840
Keep your eye on this down here. Okay.

2055
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,679
Boom. There's that larger fivem minute.

2056
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,000
Same pattern

2057
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,360
flat top right here. Easy, easy sucker

2058
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,679
play. This is when the bull flag guy is

2059
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,239
like, "Yeah, it's going to go higher."

2060
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,440
comes right back down to that D level

2061
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,199
right there. That was a sound effect

2062
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:46,000
with my tongue. Okay, don't send me

2063
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
message messages. I heard ICT just let a

2064
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,880
fart.

2065
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,880
There we go. And it just keeps going

2066
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,880
higher and it gets up to this level here

2067
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,239
and it comes all the way back down

2068
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,520
to some random 9:30 opening regular

2069
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,840
trading hours price again. Look at that.

2070
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,360
And then what does it do there? It

2071
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,199
sweeps it. It clears out the liquidity

2072
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,480
below here and then rallies up

2073
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,520
old fair gap. Picks it up here. What

2074
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,080
level? This is gold, guys. You said the

2075
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,000
doesn't work in gold, right? You

2076
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,560
clowns over there on TikTok. ICT stuff

2077
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,719
doesn't work on gold, bro. Dude, you

2078
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:23,600
don't even know what you're talking

2079
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,440
about. Like, you have no idea what the

2080
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,280
you're talking about. What's this

2081
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,040
price say right here? 4,116.5.

2082
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,880
Oh my goodness. What is the price low on

2083
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,880
that?

2084
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,080
>> To the tick.

2085
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,840
To the tick. Elliot wave.

2086
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,840
Tell me something.

2087
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,360
Dan

2088
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,080
talk to me.

2089
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,880
Supply and demand. Where art thou?

2090
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,639
Woff.

2091
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,400
Please

2092
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,840
tell me something, baby. Because Ajax

2093
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,159
ain't got nothing on me. I'll put

2094
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,920
something on your ass that Ajax won't

2095
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,120
rub off. And it's called precision. You

2096
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,360
can't touch this with anything else

2097
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,760
out there. It ain't there. Nowhere to be

2098
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,760
found.

2099
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,800
This guy loves himself. He talks about

2100
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,000
this stuff like he's

2101
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,480
rockar. No,

2102
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,159
but when you live 33 years with it and

2103
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,440
you see it and you know like the back of

2104
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,679
your hand and these out there

2105
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:34,960
that don't know what they're talking

2106
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,080
about entertain you and you just want to

2107
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,400
remind them that they know nothing. You

2108
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,239
know nothing

2109
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,040
now. My students are learning. The least

2110
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,000
of my students could ragdoll these guys

2111
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,719
that got here and talk

2112
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,280
And I just come out here once in a while

2113
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:57,760
just to remind you. Just to remind you,

2114
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,239
it's by choice. Anytime I want. Anytime

2115
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,520
I want. But there's a trading

2116
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,159
competition. ICT. You ran away. You went

2117
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,920
up to Maine. There's people saying I

2118
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,000
didn't go.

2119
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,719
your competition. In one

2120
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,800
trade, I killed everybody cumulatively.

2121
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,880
Where the are you at? your

2122
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,000
leaderboard. your leaderboard, you

2124
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,719
That's right. That is right. Talk it.

2125
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,280
Talk it all you want. I'm walking it,

2126
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,679
Anytime I want. Here's what the

2127
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,000
market's going to do. And we all watch

2128
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,600
it.

2129
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,120
Done.

2130
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,719
When's it wrong? I'll let you know. I'll

2131
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,320
let you know.

2132
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,719
So anyway, gold it apparently works in

2133
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,719
gold, but I'll leave it up to you to

2134
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:53,600
decide. It's up for it's up for debate

2135
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,639
for now. I'm going to suspend my

2136
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,159
argument on it and say I believe it

2137
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,800
works in gold, but it's up for you to

2138
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,719
determine there's any ability to or not.

2139
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,400
Okay,

2140
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,400
NASDAQ.

2141
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:10,320
All righty. And then we're going to go

2142
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,960
to uh is one man? Yeah. NQ.

2143
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,400
Yeah.

2144
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,920
Tuesday

2145
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,840
the night right there. Okay. I'll zoom

2146
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:34,960
in in a minute. Just right now. I just

2147
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,080
want to have a little bit of data on the

2148
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:39,080
chart.

2149
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,800
Some of you guys are offended.

2150
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,320
Did I Did you just say the f word? Yeah,

2151
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,719
I did. And I repent every time I do it.

2152
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,560
But I'm I'm a sinner just like all of

2153
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,000
you. Okay. Bottom line is this. Daily

2154
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,639
chart last Friday literally controlled

2155
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:57,920
demolition. Okay. I'm going to say

2156
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,679
something to you, okay? And I want you

2157
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,840
to just think about it. Not not just

2158
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,120
hear me here and come up with your own

2159
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,560
conclusion right now while the live

2160
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,400
stream's going on, but I want you to

2161
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,760
think about it the rest of the week.

2162
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,280
Okay?

2163
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:16,760
What time of year is it right now?

2164
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,520
It's in the fall.

2165
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,600
In the fall,

2166
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,360
stocks generally make a low

2167
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,080
and then they go higher

2168
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,719
into some measure of usually the last

2169
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,400
week of January, maybe the first or

2170
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,840
second week of February and then it

2171
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,280
creates some kind of short-term interm

2172
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,960
high and then starts either if it's a

2173
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,159
bearish at that point, then it starts

2174
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,080
working towards the April May highs and

2175
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,840
then this works its way down through the

2176
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,639
summer into the fall lows. But we're in

2177
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,199
a market that is being propped up. It's

2178
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,360
primarily bullish. No one can argue

2179
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,159
against that.

2180
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:54,800
But if it's in a primary bull market, it

2181
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,280
can't trade down to a fall low like we

2182
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,000
would expect in a normal, you know, nonp

2183
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,920
parabolic, you know, bull market. So,

2184
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,960
wouldn't it be suspicious

2185
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,159
to see how on one day they did a

2186
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:13,520
controlled demolition just like 9/11 and

2187
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,040
then

2188
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,280
now we went up here yesterday and now

2189
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,920
we're right here and they used this old

2190
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,040
discount wick low perfectly delivered

2191
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,880
there. Okay. And look at this

2192
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,120
candlesticks right here. The uh

2193
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,920
September 25th. What's the low? You're

2194
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,960
going to look at this price right here

2195
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,080
on my cursor right here. What's that

2196
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,320
candlestick low?

2197
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,320
24,422.50.

2198
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,520
Okay.

2199
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,639
Over here this morning,

2200
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,800
this candlestick right here, it's low

2201
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,800
24,421.

2202
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,800
Even

2203
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,560
So it hits it, trades minimum one tick

2204
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,159
below it for spread aspect, but look at

2205
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:11,679
the reaction there off of that.

2206
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,320
And then we have

2207
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,159
this inefficiency which I think if I'm

2208
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,840
not mistaken

2209
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,560
was

2210
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,000
I just messed that up. There we go. Here

2211
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,159
we go.

2212
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,480
This is this very reason right here.

2213
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,199
This is what I'm doing is the number one

2214
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,560
reason why I like doing pre-recorded

2215
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,000
videos because of my like attention to

2216
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,239
detail. I like to have the chart look

2217
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,480
exactly like I want it. I don't like to

2218
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,960
see half a candle being shown here. So,

2219
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,560
I don't like having to zoom in front of

2220
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,920
everybody while we're doing it live.

2221
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,639
But, this is the inefficiency that you

2222
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,040
see on the five-minute chart. and it

2223
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,800
trades down into a here.

2224
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,880
When we have a wick like this

2225
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,679
candlestick here and this right there,

2226
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,639
whenever it's a old inefficiency,

2227
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,400
I look at this as immediate rebalance

2228
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,840
the same way. It's immediately

2229
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,120
rebalancing because it's going right

2230
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,440
back to the top of the inefficiency,

2231
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,880
which is this candlestick's opening

2232
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,920
price here. It need not trade down to

2233
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,120
that. It's doing the same function as a

2234
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,400
candlestick to candlestick touch. Like

2235
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,159
in other words, if this candlestick's

2236
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:30,080
high, touch this candlesticks low.

2237
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,480
That's immediate rebalance. This is the

2238
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,400
same element of immediate rebalance

2239
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,239
because it's using the inefficiencies

2240
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:41,040
high as the immediate rebalance. It's

2241
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,719
going right down to it like that. And

2242
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,159
even though there's a small little gap,

2243
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,960
guess what that's telling you also?

2244
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,560
Would you want to see that close in if

2245
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,560
it's bullish? If you're bullish and you

2246
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,080
wanted to see it go higher, would you

2247
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,600
really want to see that if it touches

2248
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,679
the high of that inefficiency? Would you

2249
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:56,960
really want to see that completely close

2250
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,440
in based on what I've been teaching? No,

2251
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,280
you wouldn't. Why? Because it's

2252
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,719
indicating that it doesn't even want to

2253
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,360
give that discount there either. And

2254
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,719
that's exactly what I call it a

2255
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,440
signature for smart money sees that and

2256
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,440
it's like a flag to them. It's like a

2257
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,600
big alert. See, you look at price action

2258
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,199
indicators and things crossing over uh

2259
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:18,719
becoming overbought, oversold, and

2260
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,440
that's a a catalyst for you to make a

2261
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,840
decision, an action point for you to

2262
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,560
react and do something.

2263
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,239
Smart money doesn't have that because

2264
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:33,520
it's all horseshit. What it does is it

2265
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,040
knows where price goes below an old low,

2266
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,480
there's liquidity down there. They're

2267
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,239
not looking at depth of market. They're

2268
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:42,080
not looking at level two. They're not

2269
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,920
doing any of that They know that

2270
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,840
there's liquidity down there. They're

2271
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,560
taking that liquidity, absorbing it,

2272
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,480
buying it, and then they're looking for

2273
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,320
continuation setups like these things

2274
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,320
here. It tells you it's not likely to go

2275
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,920
lower because it's leaving these portion

2276
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:01,440
of price action open. What What's this?

2277
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,840
Relative equal highs. Right high is

2278
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,320
lower than the left. This is a strong

2279
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,480
candidate for price wanting to run

2280
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,199
through. Same thing here. High, lower,

2281
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:15,520
high. Big big bulletin board. Like going

2282
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,960
down the road, driving on interstate.

2283
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,000
You see these bulletin boards

2284
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,560
advertising gas stations, businesses. If

2285
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,760
you're in driving through New Jersey,

2286
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,440
this hole of state. Everybody wants

2287
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,320
to sue everybody down there. I'm injured

2288
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,120
in jersey.com. There's so many lawyers

2289
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,639
advertising in Jersey. It's

2290
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,080
unbelievable. I was telling my wife, I

2291
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,840
was like, "Look at this place. Like

2292
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,719
everything here is literally about suing

2293
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,560
somebody about a car accident. Did a

2294
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,360
truck driver go by too fast? Call us. We

2295
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,719
got something we can put on our ass.

2296
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:46,560
Yeah, it's nuts. Well, in price action,

2297
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,320
these PD arrays and the signatures they

2298
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,000
provide you is like a big billboard sign

2299
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,400
like that advertising. This is what you

2300
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,159
should be expecting. This is what you're

2301
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,480
looking for. But everybody's looking for

2302
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,320
patterns. They're looking for individual

2303
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,040
candlestick patterns. You know, they're

2304
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,920
creating new forms of ranges. There's no

2305
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,400
advantage to that. You want a timebased

2306
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,120
candlestick because the market is driven

2307
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,840
algorithmically based on time. If you

2308
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,199
skew any information that is linked to

2309
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:21,040
time, you have greatly diminished your

2310
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,920
effectiveness in terms of timing the

2311
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,840
market with the process that it uses for

2312
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,480
protraction. When the market starts to

2313
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,600
run, this is this is protraction where

2314
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,320
it just starts to escape and run and it

2315
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,159
runs above those relative go highs here

2316
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,480
and it continues to go higher. But I

2317
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,679
want you to see how it uses this old

2318
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,920
discount wick when price was up here. It

2319
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,920
opened and traded down through previous

2320
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,600
days

2321
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,040
low and into the new week opening gap

2322
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,719
which is this candlestick's closed and

2323
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,520
this candlestick's open.

2324
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,440
Go back to a one minute chart.

2325
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,760
If you're learning from this and you can

2326
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,040
see past the rant because I'm just

2327
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,639
having fun. Um, give it a thumbs up and

2328
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,159
it'll encourage me to do more of them.

2329
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,040
It doesn't mean I'm going to come out

2330
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,960
here every day now, but the uh

2331
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,960
the candlesticks bodies are respecting

2332
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,760
the high of that fivem minute

2333
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,000
inefficiency that you can't see on the

2334
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,199
one minute chart. See how it's all

2335
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:32,600
muddied up

2336
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,320
rallies up and then now look what it's

2337
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:37,800
using here. 24,582.25

2338
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,639
upper quadrant of this discount wick.

2339
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,960
Okay, so the 25th of September, we're

2340
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,280
trading up to

2341
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:50,960
and above that upper quadrant. Look real

2342
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,199
real close, folks.

2343
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,520
Real close.

2344
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,520
We traded to the low of that wick on the

2345
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,800
25th of September. Right there. Nails

2346
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,360
the low of the day. ICT says he can pick

2347
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:08,000
the low the market. I was doing that in

2348
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,440
Forex over and over and over again.

2349
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,800
over and over and over again. And they

2350
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,639
were trying to say I was using a a a

2351
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,400
what's it called? What's it called

2352
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,440
again? It's escaping me. A rented white

2353
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,239
label server, which is apparently a real

2354
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:26,080
thing. Um, but I never did that. I never

2355
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,239
had to do that. Do you am I using some

2356
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,320
kind of manipulation when I put it on

2357
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,120
Twitter and X before it happens and it

2358
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,440
does exactly what it's outlined in my in

2359
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,040
my tweet or or post to the very levels

2360
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,199
immediately after I post it in the

2361
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,639
direction I say it was going to go. How

2362
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,960
many times have you seen me do it? If

2363
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,800
you were in my mentorship group that

2364
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,040
paid me, I was behind a payw wall where

2365
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,920
these people would have roasted my ass

2366
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,800
in public and said, "Oh, he's a liar. He

2367
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,719
can't find a trade. He can't do this. He

2368
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:58,000
can't call the market. He can't do that.

2369
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,360
He's wrong all the time. That was never

2370
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:03,520
happening. I was in a high 90% bracket

2371
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,360
for years.

2372
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,800
And I had to do something with them

2373
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,960
every single day. Every single day.

2374
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,880
That's unheard of, folks. That is

2375
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,880
unheard of consistency. And these

2376
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,159
clowns out there talking about

2377
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,159
he doesn't have a track record. I

2378
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:20,400
will run circles around you and moonwalk

2379
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:25,280
on your just like that. Okay. I'm

2380
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,040
getting older. I just I'm slowing down,

2381
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,360
that's all. I ain't forgetting I

2382
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,239
know how to do this.

2383
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:36,880
But it hits that low and stops.

2384
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,679
And then it rallies up and it does

2385
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,600
something strange, unheard of.

2386
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,320
It climbs above the lower quadrant of

2387
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,600
that discount wick right there at 24,475

2388
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,159
and 3/4.

2389
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,280
Take a deep breath.

2390
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,960
Um, ground yourself. Ready? This is This

2391
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,040
is how easy this stuff is. This is why

2392
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,639
it's as easy for me to go out here and

2393
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,400
to do this. And my students are learning

2394
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,159
to do this, too. So, it's transferable

2395
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,600
knowledge. It's not me out here talking

2396
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,760
all this and trying to sound

2397
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,360
powerful, and I love the sound of my

2398
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,360
voice, and it's all ego trip. I'm being

2399
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,440
funny. You may not like the humor I'm

2400
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,719
using, but I'm having a great

2401
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,000
time with it, and I don't care if it

2402
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
offends you.

2403
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,840
these quadrant levels whether they're on

2404
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,199
an inefficiency like a fair value gap or

2405
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:26,719
um

2406
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:28,639
an actual gap in price where there's no

2407
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,480
trading at all or it's a wick which we

2408
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:36,000
treat the same way both of those things

2409
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,120
I guess technically would be three

2410
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:40,000
things right no no price at all is a

2411
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,480
vacuum block which is no that's a real

2412
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,719
gap there's an inefficiency buy sign

2413
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,639
balance sell sign efficiency sell sign

2414
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:49,280
balance buy sign efficiency civ busy

2415
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,400
those are fair value gaps, their

2416
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,920
inefficiencies.

2417
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,520
And then you have the candlestick wicks.

2418
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,760
We treat them the same way. We grade

2419
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,239
them

2420
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,719
all. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen

2421
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:03,360
to me.

2422
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,320
I I read I read these on

2423
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,880
another channel today. And I love doing

2424
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,880
this. If I didn't know what I was doing,

2425
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,080
this would really break my heart and it

2426
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,040
would hurt me. It would hurt my

2427
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,800
feelings. Admittedly, I'm I'm not trying

2428
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,719
to be funny. If I didn't know what I was

2429
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,480
doing, some of these comments would

2430
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,440
genuinely hurt my feelings when they say

2431
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,440
fair value gaps are trash. They don't

2432
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,840
work. They don't ever work.

2433
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,239
And I'm going to tell you young men,

2434
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:30,880
okay? You masters of the fine art of

2435
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,080
virginity, I'm going to tell you

2436
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,760
something right now that's going to help

2437
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,239
you. It's going to help you in your

2438
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:39,280
pursuit of that perfect lady that you

2439
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,880
can whine and dine and finally afford

2440
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,320
more than the dollar menu at

2441
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,520
McDonald's. Here it is. You ready? Every

2442
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,480
high probability fair value gap, every

2443
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,280
one of them

2444
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:54,480
lays on top of a quadrant that I've been

2445
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,239
teaching you since I started back here

2446
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:59,239
again.

2447
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,480
Real real close.

2448
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:06,400
What do you see at 24,475 and 3/4? What

2449
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,400
do you see?

2450
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,800
>> What do you see?

2451
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,719
>> Ready? We went down to the low of that

2452
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,480
wick

2453
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,960
and then it starts to go higher and

2454
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,040
pulls back to this quadrant in your

2455
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,080
mind. Okay. How's ICT going to think

2456
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,840
about this? What's the what's the

2457
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,040
internal dialogue of ICT? What's the

2458
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:32,719
inner musing of ICT?

2459
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,560
Mhm.

2460
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:38,719
Well, if we rode this down.

2461
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:40,800
Well,

2462
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,600
well, Then I can use an imbalance

2463
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,320
on the pathway down.

2464
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:50,480
That means Well, this is one right here.

2465
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,920
But is it on top that quadrant level?

2466
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:59,199
No, Virginia, it's not. But look,

2467
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:03,199
look. What do you got here? Oh, look at

2468
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,600
that. We got this one right here. You

2469
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,800
see that? Well,

2470
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:12,239
boom,

2471
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,960
boom.

2472
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,239
Where's the consequent encroachment of

2473
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:18,800
that fair value gap at the

2474
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,400
perfect level on that quadrant? Is that

2475
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,679
one thing telling you? Nope.

2476
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,159
It all by itself.

2477
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:32,159
No.

2478
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:34,880
It's not.

2479
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,480
It's telling you that right here, right

2480
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,320
here is that sweet spot and you can

2481
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:45,040
accumulate a long right there and you

2482
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,520
need not concern yourself with this

2483
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,000
bullish breaker.

2484
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,960
If it's bullish, would it want to wait

2485
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,320
around to come back for a bullish

2486
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:01,199
breaker? If this is a V bottom.

2487
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,199
Nope.

2488
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:08,639
Rips right through it and leaves this

2489
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,960
right there.

2490
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,760
And YouTube mentors with my stuff in

2491
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,560
their mouth will say, "I will really

2492
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,159
love to take a trade right here if they

2493
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,520
can come back and trade into that

2494
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,600
because it broke structure right here."

2495
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,840
That is the worst bit of advice

2496
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,719
you could ever take from somebody trying

2497
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:29,199
to talk like me. You might have my

2498
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,360
words. You might have some of my

2499
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,760
vocabulary,

2500
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,280
but you have no idea what the

2501
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,679
you're talking about. This is what you

2502
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:40,880
want to see when it's bullish.

2503
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:46,320
And here's 9:30 right there. Okay, keep

2504
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,239
going forward. What do you see right

2505
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:51,440
there? What is that?

2506
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:54,400
What is that?

2507
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:57,920
Holy smokes. That's that he said.

2508
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,480
First, present the fair value gap. Oh my

2509
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,800
goodness. I already see. I already pick

2510
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,360
it up in the force. The Jedi Knight

2511
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,800
knows exactly what's going on. You're

2512
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,840
all vibrating right now.

2513
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:17,520
First guy just weapons. It just

2514
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,080
happens to lay right on top of the upper

2515
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,239
quadrant

2516
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:28,560
of that discount. Wait, ICT cherry picks

2517
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,520
the perfect PD arrays all the

2518
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,040
time.

2519
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,360
It's got to be Photoshop.

2520
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,239
It's got to be hindsight. He's got to be

2521
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:41,119
using 30 laptops. He's got to be

2522
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,000
doing it. I can't sleep. How is

2523
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,480
he doing it?

2524
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:53,159
I love it.

2525
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,280
Here is

2526
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,639
Oh man, you're going to love

2527
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:01,440
these books. Ready? Here's the low. And

2528
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,560
here is

2529
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,600
Watch this.

2530
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,520
You're going to tell me. You're going to

2531
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,360
tell me that buying and selling

2532
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,760
pressure. You're gonna tell me that that

2533
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,880
just so happens to match the

2534
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,400
up

2535
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,360
with consequent encroachment. And if you

2536
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,280
don't see it that way, here's your fair

2537
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:27,280
value gap laying right on top

2538
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,040
of the halfway point or consequent

2539
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,080
encroachment of the first percent of

2540
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:33,480
fair value gap.

2541
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,560
Now roll that film film footage back

2542
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:44,159
on X when we were trading right there.

2543
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:48,520
I said 24,660

2544
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:52,239
relative equal highs too smooth or

2545
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:56,000
smooth edges to that effect. And I said

2546
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,960
watch new week opening gap in here.

2547
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,400
That's right here on this candlestick.

2548
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,320
Don't take my word for it. Grab the very

2549
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:09,920
tweet or post on X that I said that.

2550
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,840
Copy the link to it and then go to

2551
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,679
Trading View, right click with your

2552
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:15,600
mouse button when you're looking at the

2553
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:18,000
chart like this, and it'll lay my tweet

2554
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,440
right down on that candlestick right

2555
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,679
there. And it will say what I just said.

2556
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,199
And then the market does something

2557
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:26,080
completely random.

2558
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,400
Something nobody on this spinning rock

2559
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,960
could have ever known about. They never

2560
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,560
could have saw it. They never would have

2561
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,000
had the foresight to be able to say it

2562
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,600
before it happened. They never would

2563
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,679
have said it was going to do this very

2564
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:40,719
thing because nobody can time the

2565
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,719
market. Nobody knows what price is going

2566
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,199
to do. Nobody can predict the future.

2567
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,760
Nobody.

2568
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,800
And my middle name is nobody

2569
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,199
because the market goes up and trades

2570
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:55,119
right back down to that new week opening

2571
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:57,760
gap high

2572
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,280
and does what?

2573
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,679
leaves,

2574
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,600
takes off,

2575
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,520
and then we get first percent fair value

2576
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,760
gap. It becomes an inversion fair value

2577
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,560
gap because it's civi here.

2578
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,320
Now, remember, I'm I'm down here. I'm

2579
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,760
calling your attention to 24,660.

2580
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,080
So, let's do some simple deductions

2581
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,800
here, okay? I'm I'm going to help these

2582
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,719
guys that don't understand. When I post

2583
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,040
something, it's very specific. It's not

2584
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,560
ambiguous. It's not both sides of the

2585
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,520
equation. It's literally me saying

2586
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,199
24,660 is going to be tagged

2587
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:37,360
and it's going to start and originate

2588
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:41,360
off of new week opening gap high.

2589
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,119
There's no way you can twist

2590
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,600
that in any other format. There's no way

2591
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,199
you can do that. You can't say I'm

2592
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:49,199
looking to go short. You're not looking

2593
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:52,080
for lower prices ICT. You clearly said

2594
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,719
you're looking for 24,660 and you're

2595
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:56,560
looking for the new week opening gap

2596
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,199
high as a kickoff.

2597
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:01,119
Yes.

2598
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,360
Does your chart looks like that? Does it

2599
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,600
look like that? I didn't even mention

2600
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,320
the first percent because I'm in there

2601
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:11,320
before.

2602
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,080
You don't need to be down here. You

2603
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,639
don't need to be here. You don't need to

2604
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,719
be here.

2605
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:23,360
You can be right there

2606
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,320
and do very, very well.

2607
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,400
The problem is when you see me teach

2608
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,639
this way, you may be doing this really,

2609
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,560
really consistently and doing it well

2610
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,480
and then you see you're trying to tell

2611
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,480
me that you went long here and you added

2612
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,480
here and you added here and you added

2613
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:42,480
here and you got out. I want to do that.

2614
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,159
That makes you hard to teach as a

2615
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:47,280
student because you're not content with

2616
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,880
enough.

2617
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,560
Every little bit of progress that you

2618
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,800
have needs to be championed in your

2619
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,880
study journal. You ch you cheerlead

2620
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,000
yourself. You you you speak positive

2621
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,760
things about what you're learning and

2622
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,400
how empowered you feel by having learned

2623
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,760
it. Even if you don't see it real time,

2624
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,280
you want to go into your journal and

2625
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,040
say, "This is what I see in the charts

2626
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,119
right now." Okay? And then you write it

2627
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:14,080
in your journal like you saw it. You are

2628
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,639
lying to yourself, but in a positive

2629
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:18,480
way. You're encouraging yourself. Say,

2630
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,800
"It would be no different." Okay? It

2631
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,320
would be no different if you had your

2632
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,840
small son or daughter and they were

2633
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,320
trying to do something in some kind of

2634
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,600
acti activity or sport and you're going

2635
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,080
to tell them, "Hey, look. You didn't win

2636
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,960
today, but you did so good. You don't

2637
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,520
worry. You'll get them next time. How

2638
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:40,800
the do you know that you're going

2639
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,880
to get them next time?" You don't. But

2640
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,119
you love that little child because

2641
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,520
they're yours and you want to build them

2642
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,280
up. You don't look at that as a

2643
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:52,639
lie, but it is. You're lying. You don't

2644
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:54,560
know what the hell's going to happen.

2645
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,560
The next time it could be worse, but

2646
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,639
you're doing what? You're instilling

2647
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:01,280
encouragement. You're nurturing that

2648
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,840
child who you love. Well, guess what?

2649
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,400
Until you are a asskicking

2650
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,840
one-man army, you're a child as

2651
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,040
a traitor. And they have to be nurtured.

2652
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,880
They have to be guarded from these evil

2653
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,800
pieces of on the internet that

2654
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,560
don't do anything but work at 7 and

2655
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,320
11 or pump gas.

2656
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:26,000
They got opinions about everybody else.

2657
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,080
When you're small and you're

2658
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,639
insecure about what you may or may not

2659
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:35,280
know about trading, you're easily

2660
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,639
influenced by the opinions of other

2661
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,639
people. Even if you know deep in your

2662
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:39,679
heart that they're probably full of

2663
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:42,159
you are hurt by them, by the

2664
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:44,880
things they say. That's why I tell you,

2665
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,320
listen, it's your choice. You can listen

2666
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,960
to other people's opinion about me.

2667
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,480
Listen to it for a little while and then

2668
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:53,119
watch what I'm doing and then see which

2669
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:57,040
one which one holds the weight. Okay?

2670
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,760
Hold your hands out. in one hand

2671
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,119
and wish in the other. See which one

2672
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:04,000
fills up first. That's that's the that's

2673
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,320
the way you weigh this out.

2674
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,000
Because if I don't know what I'm talking

2675
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,040
about, you're going to see it real fast.

2676
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,880
But if I do know what I'm talking about,

2677
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,119
you're going to see that real fast,

2678
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,920
consistently over and over and over and

2679
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:18,880
over again. And then you're going to

2680
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,480
understand, oh no wonder his

2681
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:21,520
students are the ones that

2682
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,040
always make the money. No wonder

2683
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,880
he's the guy that put these

2684
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,119
people in positions where they

2685
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:30,840
no longer work.

2686
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,400
But you're going to listen to these ass

2687
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,000
these clowns, these people, these

2688
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,080
stupid They are

2689
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,400
so ate up with misery. They wouldn't

2690
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,040
want nothing more to see more people

2691
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,800
join their ranks and say ICT is a

2692
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,760
fraud. If you are weak-minded

2693
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,199
and you don't really want to do this,

2694
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:49,760
join them. Talk all the you want

2695
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,840
about me because all that does is bring

2696
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,000
more people here and then they witness

2697
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,719
what you see me do today. What I did in

2698
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:00,560
October first live stream. Every time I

2699
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,400
talk about the market, it's

2700
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,320
marching to this pi piper's

2701
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,719
tune. I told you I'm not going to come

2702
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,320
out here and look stupid now.

2703
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,159
Okay? I'm not going to do it. It's not

2704
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:15,080
in me. It's not in my nature to do that

2705
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:17,280
because I know

2706
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,719
there are so many people around the

2707
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:20,880
world. Millions of people and I

2708
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,639
know it's millions because most of the

2709
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:24,880
comments are left in my uh channel are

2710
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,400
left by people that are not subscribed.

2711
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,920
And I almost got two million people

2712
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,000
follow me now on the viewership

2713
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,880
subscription side of it.

2714
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:37,199
I know what I say has weight. I know

2715
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,360
it's going to influence a lot of people.

2716
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:43,520
I'm not going to take some guess.

2717
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,719
I'm not going to come out here and talk

2718
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,080
about something that I haven't already

2719
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,159
talked about and taught. So that way

2720
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:50,800
when I say things like I said today, any

2721
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,320
student that's been following me just

2722
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,080
for

2723
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,880
a month would have knew exactly what I

2724
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,159
was saying today.

2725
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:01,280
And then you see other people that are

2726
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,080
brand new. They're like, "I don't

2727
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,080
understand what he's talking about." And

2728
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,520
you see other people say, "Yeah, I I was

2729
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,800
just like that, too. I'm so thankful. I

2730
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,520
understand what the hell he's talking

2731
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,199
about. I understand his language." Now,

2732
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:12,239
that's what you get when you spend time

2733
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:14,400
studying. When you listen to the videos

2734
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:17,119
and you take notes, you don't watch the

2735
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,800
videos listening for tell me when to

2736
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,320
buy, tell me when to sell, give me a

2737
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,520
signal, give me a setup, you get the

2738
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,840
out of here. Get out of here. Get

2739
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,719
out of here. I don't have any interest

2740
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:28,560
in doing that. I want to teach you how

2741
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,040
to find this on your own.

2742
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,719
That's what I'm doing. I'm not telling

2743
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:35,440
you, here, eat right now. Here's a meal

2744
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:38,480
for you right now. I'm giving you a

2745
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,800
gourmet kitchen and a whole

2746
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:43,760
pantry stocked with the best choices of

2747
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,080
cuts of meat you've ever had. And all

2748
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,320
you have to do is sit your ass in the

2749
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:49,760
kitchen and make whatever it is you want

2750
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,199
to make.

2751
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:52,719
Ain't nobody around here going to be

2752
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:55,360
able to tell you you can't eat

2753
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:59,199
on your own time and by your own hand.

2754
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:01,119
That's the power of being able to take

2755
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,760
this stuff and making it yours. That's

2756
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:05,600
why I'm here. That's why I'm not getting

2757
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,199
paid. That's why I'm not

2758
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:10,639
stopping. That's why I do it. That's why

2759
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:13,920
I do it. Because I know there's a lot of

2760
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,679
you out there. You've tried everything

2761
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,280
else and you failed because everything

2762
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,880
else is

2763
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:26,400
It's all dog and pony show. Sure, they

2764
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,760
might get once in a while get lucky here

2765
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:31,040
and there, but nobody,

2766
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,960
nobody

2767
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,080
is this consistent else. Nowhere. It

2768
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,400
ain't no You find them and you

2769
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:41,119
bring their asses here. I

2770
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:44,560
promise you I will their asses up

2771
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:47,280
publicly live stream. Bring your Mickey

2772
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:50,000
Mouse and I will moonwalk

2773
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
all over you. But they never do it. They

2774
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,760
got all these side quest They

2775
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,199
Well, let's do this. Let's do that.

2776
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,679
all that. Sit your ass out here every

2777
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:01,360
day and tell us what the it's going

2778
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,760
to do to the tick.

2779
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,880
Then you got a voice.

2780
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,719
Now you get either the stone cold side

2781
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:10,800
of me or you get the mild

2782
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,639
mattered

2783
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:15,600
well soft spoken and blah blah blah. You

2784
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:18,719
pick what the do you want. What do

2785
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,400
you want? You want rocky road or you

2786
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,920
want vanilla ice cream? Whatever

2787
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,119
the it is, tap into that because I

2788
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:26,960
can do it the ugly way or I can do it

2789
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,880
the nice way. But when I listen to

2790
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,679
stupid people listening to

2791
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:33,360
dumb sent to me in a

2792
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,440
email. I saw this guy talk to

2793
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,040
you about talk about you this and and he

2794
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,280
talk about man do you even pay

2795
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,880
attention?

2796
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,880
Do you even listen to the things I'm

2797
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,400
talking about when the mark when

2798
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,599
I do the reviews and I tell you this is

2799
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:46,560
what I think the market's going to do.

2800
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:47,520
It's going to it's going to do this.

2801
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,280
It's going to use that. When I type this

2802
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:52,719
out into a text that's time and

2803
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:55,520
date stamped on X and nothing is ever

2804
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,400
deleted or edited. Do you ever

2805
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:01,599
pay attention to that?

2806
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:02,960
Because if you aren't paying attention

2807
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:05,360
to that, then you can't be a

2808
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,840
traitor. Like, you're you're missing the

2809
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,880
obvious

2810
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,880
And that's what I get most of the time

2811
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,440
in my comment section from people that

2812
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:19,360
are just wanting to be, you know, spoon

2813
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:22,480
spoonfed signals and setups.

2814
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:25,440
If I believed in my heart, okay, listen

2815
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,280
to me.

2816
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,360
If I believed in my heart that that

2817
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:32,000
would make you independently wealthy and

2818
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,360
you'd be able to learn how to trade by

2819
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,719
doing that, man, I would do it.

2820
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:38,320
I clearly know what I'm doing. Every

2821
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,520
time I talk to you and show you where

2822
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,560
this going to go, how it's going to

2823
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,639
behave, I used to sit out here and do

2824
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:43,840
one candle at a time. It's going to do

2825
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,119
this, watch, it's going to do this, it's

2826
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,159
not going to do that, and it would

2827
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:49,920
do it like time traveling.

2828
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,239
There's nobody else out there, folks,

2829
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:55,440
doing that I want to see I want to

2830
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:59,199
see Al Brooks who people say, "Oh, um, I

2831
01:52:59,199 --> 01:53:01,679
stole his shit." I

2832
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,360
want to see Al Brooks call every

2833
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,360
candle where it's going to go. Stop. It

2834
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:07,119
won't do this. I want to see that. Every

2835
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:08,719
bit of respect to the man. I don't know

2836
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,320
him. You really, I don't know him, but I

2837
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,480
want to see that. I If he live

2838
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,480
stream, I would be in attendance every

2839
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,800
day. Every day, I would

2840
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,320
be there because I want to see it.

2841
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,719
Hearing people say that you can do it.

2842
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:24,400
See, it'd be different if I just always

2843
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,639
said said said said I can I can I can

2844
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:29,280
and I never did it.

2845
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,520
See, if you tell a lie big enough and

2846
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:34,960
long enough, people will believe it.

2847
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,480
But when you tell the truth all

2848
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:37,840
the time and you can get out

2849
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,360
here and walk that anytime you

2850
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,840
want, it's undeniable. It's

2851
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:45,119
undeniable. And that's where I live. I

2852
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:47,280
live in the truthville. I don't live in

2853
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,440
some Mickey Mouse madeup land some

2854
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,920
Okay? I don't rely on all of you to talk

2855
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,239
for me that none of this shit's real. I

2856
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:55,679
can come out here and do this anytime I

2857
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:57,920
want and I want you to realize

2858
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,199
that yes, yes,

2859
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:02,960
this is not the appropriate way of doing

2860
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,800
it for all audiences. And I understand

2861
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,679
that. I understand that. But it pisses

2862
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,679
me off. Not because my feelings are

2863
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,280
getting hurt, but it pisses me off that

2864
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,679
some of you let these ignorant pieces of

2865
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:17,119
tear down the joy of you pursuing

2866
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:19,199
something that if you just took

2867
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:21,119
one day

2868
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,199
and realistically weighed out the things

2869
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:25,840
I'm putting out here.

2870
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,400
Is there any truth to it? I don't give a

2871
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:29,920
what they say about me. I don't

2872
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,599
care. I don't sleep. I don't sleep with

2873
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:32,880
my eyes waking up every five

2874
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,880
minutes. I wonder if they're going to

2875
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,320
think about that. that I

2876
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:39,280
sleep like a baby.

2877
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:40,880
This is not going to stop working.

2878
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,880
Okay, it's not. When the market stop

2879
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,639
being traded freely, then it won't.

2880
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:46,320
There's your answer for that. But it

2881
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,320
pisses me off that people I just

2882
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,080
started. I followed your channel. I've

2883
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,239
been watching you for a couple weeks and

2884
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:54,000
I I really like what I'm seeing, but I

2885
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,639
saw this guy on YouTube. I see this guy.

2886
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,320
He's got videos about you and this that

2887
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,239
other thing. Blah blah blah. I'm like,

2888
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:02,080
okay,

2889
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:04,159
I don't have time to reply all of you. I

2890
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:05,599
don't I don't have time to reply. So,

2891
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:08,000
I'm going to say it this way.

2892
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,840
before you sit down and you want to send

2893
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,000
me an email about the conflicts that

2894
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,280
you're having internally about whether

2895
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,760
you should learn from me or not. If you

2896
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,679
haven't studied

2897
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:19,679
where I'm calling the market and I put

2898
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:23,599
that on Twitter, I did it in

2899
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,119
Telegram.

2900
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:29,280
And all you have to do is whenever I

2901
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,440
make a post, so I'm right behind that

2902
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,639
post, whatever post it is, and say,

2903
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:36,800
"Hey, calling on all paid ICT mentorship

2904
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,080
students. Did this guy really for years

2905
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,440
call the market in front of you all with

2906
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,520
a 90 high 90% accuracy every single day

2907
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:51,599
for years? Or is that just a myth?" And

2908
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:56,800
let them sound off. Okay, that's it. And

2909
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,560
collect your information, your your

2910
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,480
evidence, your data about what it is I'm

2911
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,599
teaching, what I talk about in the

2912
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:04,000
marketplace, and how the market behaves

2913
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,719
immediately after that.

2914
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:09,040
You have the easiest litmus test to know

2915
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,400
whether or not that I'm a waste of time

2916
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,400
for you or not.

2917
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,400
And I mean that sincerely. I don't

2918
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,679
personally care if you come back and

2919
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,520
watch my videos. I don't care. I don't

2920
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,119
care.

2921
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:21,679
But it bothers me that I see people that

2922
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:23,920
have such a defeated mindset that they

2923
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:27,440
would give the power of choice, freedom,

2924
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:30,159
and pursuit of excellence to some

2925
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:32,639
strangers on the internet.

2926
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:34,080
That's what social media was created

2927
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,599
for, influence, but not to build you up.

2928
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:40,320
It was to defeat you mentally and divide

2929
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,320
us all.

2930
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,000
And I don't give a about anybody's

2931
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,719
opinion about me. I don't care. I know

2932
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:49,119
who I am. I know what I can do and I

2933
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:51,840
know why I'm doing this and none of you

2934
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,280
have an answer for why I'm doing it

2935
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,440
because you're looking for the there's

2936
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,119
got to be an out. Yeah, but you make so

2937
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:58,639
much money in ad revenue. The

2938
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:01,040
I don't make hardly nothing. I I make

2939
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:03,599
hardly nothing.

2940
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:06,080
It's money.

2941
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:10,800
Last Friday smokes all that stuff.

2942
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,880
Then why am I making 15 videos a

2943
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,880
day? I could listen if I was hungry for

2944
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,440
money. Okay,

2945
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,119
this has turned into a tour space in

2946
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:22,760
case you haven't noticed it.

2947
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,239
If I can make all this money in ad

2948
01:57:24,239 --> 01:57:26,480
revenue, why don't I do a a a London

2949
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:30,400
open review, a New York open review, an

2950
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,560
equities morning session review, a

2951
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,880
London close recap, and then a PM

2952
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,360
session, and then an Asian session

2953
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,360
video. And I could do all that I

2954
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:40,719
could make the charts real quick and

2955
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:42,400
have it all done in a fiveminute trainer

2956
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:46,639
video and then pump pump it all up.

2957
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:50,719
I got a life, man. I have a life.

2958
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:52,320
If I want to make money, I push a couple

2959
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,880
buttons. It's done. It's it. It's over.

2960
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,880
It's done.

2961
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,760
But I don't have the energy or the time

2962
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,840
that I had when I was a younger man to

2963
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,599
make all the videos and all that because

2964
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:05,679
I' i've done a lot of teaching. It's

2965
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:07,599
it's on my literally it's on my YouTube

2966
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:10,599
channel.

2967
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,639
Then you want to find a shortcut to all

2968
01:58:12,639 --> 01:58:14,000
those videos when all you have to do is

2969
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,679
just pick one playlist and start with

2970
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:17,760
it. And there's not none of them none of

2971
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,000
it is really the wrong starting point

2972
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,119
because they're all going to be talking

2973
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:23,520
about the same things eventually

2974
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,840
and repetition is is required. If you

2975
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,679
really want to know something, you you

2976
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:30,719
need to have some redundancy to it. And

2977
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,480
when you talk to these people with the

2978
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,560
attention span of anat because they've

2979
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,400
been programmed from Tik Tok, it's got

2980
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,480
to be 30 seconds or less or you know

2981
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,719
they're not getting right to the point.

2982
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:44,159
I'm sorry, dumbass. Okay, but you can't

2983
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:46,719
take something highly intelligent like

2984
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:48,239
this where you're competing against the

2985
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:51,520
highest intelligence in the world who

2986
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,599
controls the financial markets of the

2987
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:55,760
entire globe and you want this

2988
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,159
to be condensed and distilled down to a

2989
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:00,400
Tik Tok.

2990
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,599
Get the out of here. I have no

2991
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:05,840
tolerance for stupid people. And that is

2992
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,159
stupid right there. I have

2993
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:10,080
no tolerance for that kind of I

2994
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,840
had people paying me and they had that

2995
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:13,760
mentality as students in mentorship. The

2996
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,320
2021 group, what the That was the

2997
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,840
biggest mistake I ever did when

2998
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,280
I when I opened it up for that last year

2999
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:20,800
for 2021. So many people begging,

3000
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,080
please, please, please, please, man. I

3001
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,239
let that group in and I had a

3002
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:25,679
whole bunch of cryb babies.

3003
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:28,320
Okay. Oh, you you not telling us when to

3004
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,159
buy and sell, man. I'm literally

3005
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:32,080
telling you how to get in there. You all

3006
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,280
you have to do is do what I'm showing

3007
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,920
you right here.

3008
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,639
It doesn't change.

3009
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:42,159
It does not change.

3010
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:44,480
It's the same

3011
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:47,599
If a fair value gap doesn't have a

3012
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:51,599
rule-based idea that indicates when,

3013
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:55,760
hear that when. That's a timebased

3014
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:58,159
element,

3015
01:59:58,159 --> 02:00:00,960
not where.

3016
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,000
Where is highlighted by the

3017
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,599
inefficiency, by the fair value gap.

3018
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:05,440
That's a visual representation,

3019
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:08,719
something that you can expect.

3020
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:11,360
How did he know?

3021
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:13,760
I can't sleep. Does anybody know? Can

3022
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,400
you help me out? How did I know a for a

3023
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:17,599
fair value gap was going to form there

3024
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:18,960
before it even happened? How did

3025
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,400
he know that inversion fair value gap

3026
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,599
was going to form there before it even

3027
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:23,199
formed when I did it on the

3028
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:25,760
daily chart of the dollar index?

3029
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:28,560
Holy

3030
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:31,520
I just taught it to you.

3031
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:35,280
I just taught it to you. How much did

3032
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,599
you pay for?

3033
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,560
How much just got charged on your credit

3034
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:42,560
card to learn that lesson? Oh man, I had

3035
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,760
to listen to all this You

3036
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:44,800
could have told us that in 10 minutes at

3037
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,239
the end of the video. I have other

3038
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:48,800
things to do. you.

3039
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,159
I don't care to know about what your

3040
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:51,599
opinion of me. Every time you

3041
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:52,800
send something like that to me in a

3042
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,080
comment, you're broomed. I don't ever

3043
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,840
see your again. You say it on X,

3044
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,599
goodbye.

3045
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:00,159
You're a low intelligent piece of

3046
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:02,800
You can't see value for what it is. I'm

3047
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:05,599
literally giving you gold and I you

3048
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:07,040
don't even need to thank me. I used to

3049
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,239
ask for that. you. I don't need

3050
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:09,840
your thank you. Literally, just go do

3051
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,440
it. Make money and feed your

3052
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:14,239
family. Okay, there you go. There's no I

3053
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:16,000
don't want nothing back. I don't want

3054
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,520
anything. I just want you people that

3055
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:21,840
are struggling that you you sold

3056
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:24,560
yourself short. You listen to this

3057
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,239
world that said this is all you

3058
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:29,440
get and you better be thankful,

3059
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:32,639
man. Kiss my ass.

3060
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:35,280
your job. your college.

3061
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:36,800
your I'm going to make

3062
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:39,520
whatever the I want to make. That's

3063
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,360
how it's got to be. You got to get out

3064
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,360
there and take it by force. But you

3065
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,520
can't be guessing. And retail is a bunch

3066
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:50,159
of guessing. It's academia

3067
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:54,400
wrapped in guessing.

3068
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:57,360
plethora of books on a bookshelf.

3069
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:00,239
books out the ass. None of them

3070
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:02,480
are worth

3071
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,400
But I paid good money while working

3072
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,239
several jobs to get these books.

3073
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:07,440
And that's the only reason why I can't

3074
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,880
bring myself to burn them in my

3075
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:11,360
fireplaces.

3076
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:14,800
I hold on to them for emotional support

3077
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:17,679
because I know I've conquered everything

3078
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:19,440
else.

3079
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,599
Nothing else out there can stand

3080
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:25,280
against this. Not even close.

3081
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,280
You can't predict your

3082
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,199
indicators timing when it's going to

3083
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:31,440
give you your signal. You have to sit

3084
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:34,639
your ass there and react while you wait

3085
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:37,119
and wait and wait and then you react.

3086
02:02:37,119 --> 02:02:39,199
I'm anticipating.

3087
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:41,599
I know where my shit's coming. I

3088
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:42,960
know exactly what time them

3089
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,639
are forming and I know at

3090
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:46,239
what price. And if you haven't

3091
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:48,320
picked up on that skinny by now,

3092
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:52,320
man, today was your wakeup call.

3093
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:55,520
I know exactly what the is going

3094
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,760
on.

3095
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,119
And everybody else out there, everybody

3096
02:03:01,119 --> 02:03:03,599
else out there chasing their Mickey

3097
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:06,880
Mouse

3098
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,040
are chasing

3099
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:12,040
illusions.

3100
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,239
That's exactly what they're doing.

3101
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:19,199
They have no system.

3102
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:22,800
They don't. That's not a system.

3103
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,239
That's a recipe. I'll give you that. Add

3104
02:03:26,239 --> 02:03:28,400
this. Add that. Check pick that. If it

3105
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:29,840
does this, if it does that, and if it

3106
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,719
feel like I doing, let's take my then

3107
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:36,760
there. Okay. That's inconsistency.

3108
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:40,320
It's the epitome of retail logic and

3109
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:42,400
thinking.

3110
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,080
If the technical science doesn't line up

3111
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:46,159
like this, my ass ain't taking a

3112
02:03:46,159 --> 02:03:48,880
trade.

3113
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:51,199
Can you get that?

3114
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:54,239
There has to be something else behind

3115
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:57,520
the scenes. Behind it. There has to be

3116
02:03:57,520 --> 02:03:59,119
something behind the scenes. Just

3117
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:00,639
because that fair value gap looks like

3118
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:04,239
it's there, if it ain't laying on top of

3119
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:06,000
a quadrant that can be

3120
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,360
classified as I'm teaching you

3121
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:13,040
over a couple weeks.

3122
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,639
Real price action

3123
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:22,679
real before it happens level

3124
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,920
I did it on daily charts. I've done it

3125
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:28,400
on 15-second charts. I've done it on a

3126
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,000
5-second chart, a one second

3127
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,679
chart. Whatever the they ask me to

3128
02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:34,320
do, I've done it.

3129
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:35,760
But you can't do it this, you can't do

3130
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:38,239
that, man. I've done all that How

3131
02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:39,679
about you show me just five days

3132
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:41,199
in a row where you call a move

3133
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:42,960
where it starts and originates and ends

3134
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,159
exactly where you say it's going to

3135
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:48,320
happen when you say it.

3136
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:49,920
Because only my students can do

3137
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:52,920
that.

3138
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:56,800
Sorry. Not sorry.

3139
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:01,599
So, yes. Yes, I'm peacocking because I

3140
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:03,520
got some really good emails from

3141
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,760
students that have absolutely

3142
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,560
crushed it.

3143
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,639
Feels good, man. That gives me a

3144
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:15,199
high. I like it is so good seeing other

3145
02:05:15,199 --> 02:05:18,080
people that don't give two shits

3146
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:19,440
about being on social media. They don't

3147
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,199
need your accolade. They don't need your

3148
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:22,960
pat on the back. Oh, wow. Look at you.

3149
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:25,280
You did that. They don't need that in

3150
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:26,960
private. This is what I've done,

3151
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:29,840
Michael. I learned this. I applied that.

3152
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,040
And this is my model. And this is

3153
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:32,639
exactly what I did. Here's the

3154
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:36,880
receipts. Real receipts.

3155
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:39,119
Man, that feels good. That feels so

3156
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:42,000
good. And yes, I'm McJaggering all

3157
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,719
around this place today.

3158
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:47,360
Can you hear it? Can you hear it in my

3159
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:49,119
voice that I'm excited? You're damn

3160
02:05:49,119 --> 02:05:53,199
right. It feels good because I know what

3161
02:05:53,199 --> 02:05:55,440
they're doing and so many other people

3162
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:59,679
that you've watched in public forum.

3163
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:03,520
You can do that same thing and more

3164
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,639
and more. You're just starting.

3165
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:10,400
You're just starting, man. You have no

3166
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:13,599
idea what you can do. And I promise you,

3167
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:16,000
whatever you think the height of your

3168
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,719
successes can possibly reach, it ain't

3169
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:19,840
enough.

3170
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:22,159
It's not high enough. And you'll

3171
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:23,599
understand that when you get to that

3172
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:25,360
level and you'll be like, "Man, I was

3173
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:28,320
really underestimating myself." You have

3174
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,639
no idea the power that's in your hands

3175
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:32,159
right now. You just got to get better at

3176
02:06:32,159 --> 02:06:34,800
using it. That's all. That's all it is.

3177
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:37,760
But today is a master class. Today is

3178
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,280
PhD level revealing.

3179
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:44,960
This is the that separates

3180
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:47,199
the horseshit on YouTube, Tik Tok,

3181
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:50,800
Instagram, Discord, Facebook in uh

3182
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,320
Twitter, whatever, what the it is,

3183
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,719
whatever it is you want to name. These

3184
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,800
guys and gals out there that pretend and

3185
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:57,920
they talk about the left side of the

3186
02:06:57,920 --> 02:07:01,920
chart all the time. All the time.

3187
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,199
Now you know.

3188
02:07:05,199 --> 02:07:09,280
Now you know how ICT picks the very fair

3189
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:12,239
value gaps. Which one works, which one

3190
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:13,760
doesn't?

3191
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:15,679
And when you read these leaving

3192
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:17,520
comments, yeah, fair value gaps, they

3193
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,159
don't work. Laugh at them. Yeah, I'm not

3194
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:21,360
saying you got to go online and troll

3195
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,880
and you bully them. That's not what I'm

3196
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,079
saying. But just laugh at them.

3197
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:29,520
pity them because this video is for free

3198
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:32,880
on my YouTube channel

3199
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,199
and because of their stupidity, their

3200
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:36,800
ignorance, and they're just completely

3201
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,199
against doing what's being told to all

3202
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:40,880
of you. Sit down, roll your sleeves up,

3203
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:45,440
and watch the videos, take notes.

3204
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,800
And some of you probably thinking, all

3205
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,560
this video, all this rant and

3206
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,040
and you know, you you're wasting my

3207
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,520
time. you.

3208
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,840
How's that work for you? Because what's

3209
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,040
going to happen is you're going to get

3210
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,119
to a point where you feel like you ain't

3211
02:07:59,119 --> 02:08:00,320
going to get it and you need to be

3212
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,920
cheerleaded. You need to have your

3213
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,159
calibrated. And that's what this is for

3214
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:06,800
some of you because I have students that

3215
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,880
once in a while smash it and then they

3216
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:10,480
do dumb They go back into doing

3217
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:14,159
bad habits influenced by social media

3218
02:08:14,159 --> 02:08:16,159
and they want their corrected. And

3219
02:08:16,159 --> 02:08:18,159
that's exactly what this is. I'm

3220
02:08:18,159 --> 02:08:19,679
calibrating their ass. That's it. That's

3221
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:22,719
all it is. It ain't for you. That part

3222
02:08:22,719 --> 02:08:25,599
of the message ain't for you.

3223
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:27,119
So, when you leave me comments, whether

3224
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:30,960
it's on X or in email or on the comment

3225
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,639
section of my YouTube videos, and you

3226
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:34,800
talk to me at that just know

3227
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,719
that I'm saying, "Fuck you." And I'm

3228
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:39,199
blocking you. I don't see you anymore.

3229
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:40,880
Like, I'm not losing sleep over you. You

3230
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:43,520
see me slowing down. no. I'm still

3231
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:45,199
the same man. I'm same man. I can come

3232
02:08:45,199 --> 02:08:47,199
here anytime I want and do this

3233
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:50,159
Ain't nobody timing the market like me.

3234
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:52,079
Ain't nobody telling you what the

3235
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:56,239
it's going to do. this perfect. But me

3236
02:08:56,239 --> 02:08:59,199
and I got students that are doing so

3237
02:08:59,199 --> 02:09:02,480
great that I can't wait to see

3238
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,639
where they go. I'm telling you, they are

3239
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:08,480
going to be absolute superstars.

3240
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:12,920
Super stars.

3241
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:16,000
And you could be one of them. All you

3242
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,880
got to do is for free

3243
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:22,400
study and take notes and take the

3244
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:25,520
pursuit of this serious. Don't let other

3245
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:27,840
people influence you and make you second

3246
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,239
guess or doubt yourself.

3247
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:32,719
Honestly, man,

3248
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:35,840
if I saw what I do

3249
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:38,400
in 1992 when I first started doing this

3251
02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:41,920
if I would have saw anybody doing what I

3252
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:45,199
show you, well, there's no way.

3253
02:09:45,199 --> 02:09:48,159
There's no way it's fake.

3254
02:09:48,159 --> 02:09:51,119
There's no way. There's no way

3255
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:53,119
that you can fake beforehand. This is

3256
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:55,040
the level and this is where it's going.

3257
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:59,360
Bang. And that's all it does.

3258
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:02,560
That's all it did is that

3259
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,800
every single time this person

3260
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:07,599
says this, this is what it does. Clearly

3261
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:10,079
something's going on. Clearly there's an

3262
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:13,280
advantage here that is superseding

3263
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:15,599
everything else.

3264
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:18,079
It's now set precedents that everything

3265
02:10:18,079 --> 02:10:21,679
but this is

3266
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:25,760
And that's exactly what motivated me.

3267
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:29,599
When I didn't know anything, I knew if

3268
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:32,400
anybody on this rock

3269
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:36,239
was going to figure it out, it'd be me.

3270
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:39,440
And I couldn't.

3271
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,440
I couldn't.

3272
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:43,840
And then when I said

3273
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:47,920
I will submit

3274
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,560
and lay down my ego and lay down my

3275
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:54,560
pursuit of wanting to be somebody

3276
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:58,119
and I'll be a servant.

3277
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:01,280
I may not be polished,

3278
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:03,119
but if you look at what Jesus used all

3279
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:04,639
through the Old Testament as God when he

3280
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:07,119
selected men and women, man, that's

3281
02:11:07,119 --> 02:11:08,880
that's a list of people that you

3282
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:10,239
wouldn't expect them to do what they

3283
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:13,920
did. Moses was a murderer.

3284
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:16,400
David was an adulteress adulter and

3285
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,719
literally had the woman's husband put on

3286
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,000
the front lines so he can be with his

3287
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,880
wife. And that's a man that God says

3288
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,480
after his own heart.

3289
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:28,480
So when you look at me and you judge me,

3290
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:30,960
you Christians. Oh, look at how you're

3291
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:32,800
talking. Yes. And then when I'm done

3292
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,400
this,

3293
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,239
his spirit will be laying on me hubby

3294
02:11:36,239 --> 02:11:38,480
and I will be repenting

3295
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:41,040
just like you should be doing for

3296
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:43,920
judging me.

3297
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:48,079
I know where my weaknesses are. I know

3298
02:11:48,079 --> 02:11:50,239
where I have work to do. And it it never

3299
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:51,840
ends.

3300
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:54,560
But if it wasn't for him gifting this to

3301
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:56,960
me, this understanding, pointing these

3302
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:00,239
things out to me, no man, no man ever

3303
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:02,400
wrote a book, made a video course, sat

3304
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,239
me down and said, "This is where this is

3305
02:12:04,239 --> 02:12:07,040
doing." This is no man has did that. No

3306
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:09,599
man has ever done that in Jesus Christ's

3307
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:11,840
name. That has never ever ever ever

3308
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,840
happened.

3309
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:17,679
But that still quiet voice said, "Look

3310
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:20,480
here.

3311
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,960
Listen, I'm convinced that there are

3312
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:24,560
some very, very smart individuals in the

3313
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:28,079
world, very intelligent people, very,

3314
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:30,960
very intellect, and they would never

3315
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:34,560
find these things,

3316
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,719
but they're there.

3317
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:40,159
What's the chances of that happening?

3318
02:12:40,159 --> 02:12:43,679
And why is it that I'm attributing it to

3319
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:47,840
someone otherworldly and not just me?

3320
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:51,280
Because I could do that angle.

3321
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:52,880
If I was the piece of that some of

3322
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:55,920
you really think I am, I could really,

3323
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,760
really use that angle. Being in teaching

3324
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:01,119
circuits, going all over the place,

3325
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:04,800
making millions of dollars a week,

3326
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:08,400
milking all of you, and you would gladly

3327
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:12,480
pay it. H, how about that? I know it

3328
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,920
because you're all begging for it in the

3329
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:16,400
email still. I got people texting me my

3330
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,880
personal cell phone number. Please, I

3331
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:21,119
will pay you $30,000. I will pay you

3332
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:23,440
$50,000. I'll pay you $20,000 and send

3333
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:26,159
my NDA. Listen, I'm not doing that

3334
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:28,639
anymore. I'm not doing it anymore. This

3335
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:32,079
is the medium I chose.

3336
02:13:32,079 --> 02:13:35,040
That's it. You either sit and learn for

3337
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:38,400
free or you don't learn. That's it.

3338
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,960
That's the That's the economy here. I

3339
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,320
don't need anything from you. I don't

3340
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:44,079
want your thank you anymore. If you want

3341
02:13:44,079 --> 02:13:46,079
to tell me you're the greatest in all

3342
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:49,440
time, I am not going to like your post

3343
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:53,040
and I'm gonna set your

3344
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:55,840
focus on God. Don't don't praise me.

3345
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,960
Praise him. I don't care if you're an

3346
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,560
atheist or not. I don't care if you're a

3347
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,840
Muslim. I don't care if you're a Hindu.

3348
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,840
I don't care if you are any other

3349
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:05,199
religion. If you praise me, I'm going to

3350
02:14:05,199 --> 02:14:06,400
correct you and tell you you need to

3351
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,000
give that to God because that's who

3352
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,920
deserves it.

3353
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,840
That's where it came from. And I don't

3354
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:13,920
care if you believe that or not.

3355
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:15,760
I don't care. I could care less what you

3356
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:18,760
believe.

3357
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:22,320
But as you can see, the market comes all

3358
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:24,639
the way back up

3359
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:26,960
to

3360
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:30,639
consequent correction of this wick.

3361
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:36,360
24,738 and a quarter right here.

3362
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:44,320
743 and 3/4. It it trades there.

3363
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:49,679
and keeps diving

3364
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:53,360
deeper into all of this

3365
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:57,280
inversion fe now think I'm going to

3366
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:02,560
close the video or live stream rather

3367
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:04,079
if

3368
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:08,000
we're in the fall and I believe

3369
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,239
everybody in at least this part of the

3370
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:12,639
world would agree that you

3371
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:16,639
We're in the fall and seasonally stocks

3372
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:21,000
make a low in the fall.

3373
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:22,960
What would it look like if we're in a

3374
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:28,079
primary bullish market and the fall low

3375
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:30,719
or seasonal low formed in a bullish

3376
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:35,000
market? What what would it look like?

3377
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,719
Putting it I'm not trying to hard sell

3378
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:40,639
it right now, but just think about it.

3379
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:42,960
Couldn't it have done it in one fell

3380
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:45,679
swoop like this and cleared any trail

3381
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:48,079
stop loss below these lows below this

3382
02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:51,040
low below this low

3383
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,920
below that low and changed where it went

3384
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:55,440
back into the last change of state

3385
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,599
delivery here with this down close

3386
02:15:57,599 --> 02:16:01,199
candle and then we opened up here and

3387
02:16:01,199 --> 02:16:02,400
rallied up and then we had one more

3388
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:03,440
attempt to make it look like it was

3389
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:05,679
going to go lower again today and it

3390
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:07,280
stopped dead in its tracks on a level

3391
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:09,840
that I teach you

3392
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:14,000
discount daily wick low

3393
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,040
and then everything has been straight up

3394
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:18,880
since then.

3395
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,719
Look how it's just moon maneuvering

3396
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:22,159
around the consequent encroachment of

3397
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:23,440
that inversion fair value gap on the

3398
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,360
daily chart.

3399
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:28,800
Look at that. Isn't that neat?

3400
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:31,840
With this time distortion,

3401
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:34,719
it's like a holding pattern.

3402
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:37,359
You want to be trading

3403
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:39,120
not in these periods. You want to wait

3404
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:41,040
until it moves again. It's not a

3405
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,719
breakout. You want to wait for it to

3406
02:16:42,719 --> 02:16:44,639
start running. When the market goes into

3407
02:16:44,639 --> 02:16:47,040
another stage of protraction, then

3408
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:49,519
you'll see you'll see PDAs form again.

3409
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:51,280
and if it's suggesting it's going to

3410
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:52,960
continue higher or if it's retracing

3411
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:54,880
deeper lower

3412
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:57,840
regardless the PDAs that form after

3413
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,439
leaving

3414
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:01,760
time distortion you don't ever want to

3415
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:04,080
try to trade in these consolidations

3416
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:06,960
because you're not going to be apt to be

3417
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,679
correct in a

3418
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:11,120
limited understanding that most of you

3419
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:12,399
have right now and I don't mean to be

3420
02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:14,880
condescending I'm trying to be careful

3421
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:17,599
how I say it because I want you to be

3422
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:20,160
encouraged not defeated. I don't want

3423
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:23,760
you to feel like um

3424
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,359
like I'm talking down to you. Anytime

3425
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:27,840
I'm talking down or argumentative, it's

3426
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:29,040
the people that are doubting on the

3427
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:32,719
outside of our community or I'm taking

3428
02:17:32,719 --> 02:17:34,000
those individuals that are doubting

3429
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,599
themselves to the woodshed and I'm

3430
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:37,840
trying to shake them by the lapels.

3431
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:40,160
Like, listen, stop thinking ass

3432
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:42,559
backwards. You can do this. It's

3433
02:17:42,559 --> 02:17:44,479
transferable knowledge. you can do it,

3434
02:17:44,479 --> 02:17:46,319
but you're just trying to be unrealistic

3435
02:17:46,319 --> 02:17:48,080
with the expectations and the time

3436
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:49,760
horizon you're trying to operate in. You

3437
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:51,920
want it quick, and you can't make it

3438
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:54,960
happen quick. It takes time to study it.

3439
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:56,639
It takes time to look at charts and see

3440
02:17:56,639 --> 02:17:58,719
it repetitively over and over again. And

3441
02:17:58,719 --> 02:18:00,800
that's why I tell you to warm up to the

3442
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:03,120
idea like meditation.

3443
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:06,319
Meditation is for a trader back testing

3444
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:07,760
and journaling. If you don't want to do

3445
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:09,920
that, I promise you learning this is

3446
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,200
going to be harder than it needs to be

3447
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:12,559
and it's going to take you longer than

3448
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:14,960
anyone than you want it to be. Every

3449
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:17,519
successful business, all of them have a

3450
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:19,280
business plan. They revisit that

3451
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:21,519
business plan periodically. They have

3452
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:23,280
board meetings and they say, "Okay, how

3453
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,880
can we how can we improve? How can we

3454
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:28,960
cut costs? How can we, you know, be

3455
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:30,639
inventive

3456
02:18:30,639 --> 02:18:32,639
creating new services or products or new

3457
02:18:32,639 --> 02:18:35,679
ways of doing something?" And by having

3458
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:37,599
a journal, you're constantly measuring

3459
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:40,000
your progress. You're measuring your

3460
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,160
KPIs, your key performance indicators.

3461
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:45,120
Every business has this. Every business

3462
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:47,040
that's successful cares about these

3463
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,519
things. But when you see these people

3464
02:18:49,519 --> 02:18:53,040
that have been brain rot

3465
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:57,679
from Tik Tok and YouTube shorts, give me

3466
02:18:57,679 --> 02:19:00,080
everything I want and the least amount

3467
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:02,479
of time because I ain't got time to

3468
02:19:02,479 --> 02:19:04,479
waste on you. Nobody worth teaching

3469
02:19:04,479 --> 02:19:07,280
anything has time to waste on you. And

3470
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:09,599
you need to hear that.

3471
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:11,040
And I don't give a how that makes

3472
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:14,000
you feel. The level of entitlement today

3473
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,800
is off the charts.

3474
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:18,800
And when you care enough about yourself

3475
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:20,559
to say, you know what, I don't want to

3476
02:19:20,559 --> 02:19:22,960
halfass this.

3477
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:26,080
I want to do this the right way. I don't

3478
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:28,319
want to second guess. Do I really

3479
02:19:28,319 --> 02:19:30,080
understand it? I want to know that I

3480
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:32,639
know that I know. I want every intricate

3481
02:19:32,639 --> 02:19:36,319
detail that's made available to me.

3482
02:19:36,319 --> 02:19:38,639
Think about it. Wouldn't you want to

3483
02:19:38,639 --> 02:19:41,439
learn from any other world caliber

3484
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:44,800
athlete, artist, musician if you could

3485
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:48,160
spend time with Jimmyi Hendris and have

3486
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:52,160
him coach you on how to play the guitar?

3487
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:54,000
Like, wouldn't you want to you would

3488
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,840
want to you would spend as much time as

3489
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,600
he made available to to teach you

3490
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:58,960
whatever he's going to teach. And if he

3491
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:00,399
wanted to talk about all the times he

3492
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:02,160
smoked dope and all the girls he ran

3493
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:03,520
around with in the middle of life, you

3494
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:07,439
would endure it. You would endure it

3495
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:09,120
because you know that that's something

3496
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:10,640
that you can't get. And that's what

3497
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:11,840
you're all listening to. And I'm not

3498
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:14,000
trying to be egotistical about this

3499
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,720
because nobody else has this.

3500
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:20,080
Nobody else has this. If they did God's

3501
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:22,160
honest truth, I'd say go learn from them

3502
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:25,840
too or go from go to them.

3503
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:28,800
But it's not like that here. And I know

3504
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,800
because I've taught for three decades

3505
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,800
plus.

3506
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:37,040
I know how people think. I know how they

3507
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,120
learn. I know how they build up these

3508
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:40,479
barriers to their understanding. And

3509
02:20:40,479 --> 02:20:41,760
they do it to themselves. It's

3510
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:44,000
self-defeating.

3511
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,760
And most of it's impatience or

3512
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:48,479
unrealistic expectations. And I can't

3513
02:20:48,479 --> 02:20:50,720
fix that. That's something you have to

3514
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:53,359
work on. And this society today, these

3515
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:57,520
this generation, they don't identify it.

3516
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:00,080
It's you you have to give it to me and

3517
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,560
and if you don't, you know, you're an

3518
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:05,280
You're not worth listening to.

3519
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:07,359
When the reality is is you're not worth

3520
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:09,120
teaching.

3521
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:12,399
You're not worth investing my time in

3522
02:21:12,399 --> 02:21:15,280
because you're not teachable.

3523
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:16,800
You need to fix some things and then

3524
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:19,120
come back when you're ready. And then

3525
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:20,960
this relationship between mentor and

3526
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:23,200
mentee is going to be fruitful in your

3527
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:26,319
hands. I have it. I have limitations as

3528
02:21:26,319 --> 02:21:28,160
a teacher.

3529
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:30,800
I am cognizant of where those

3530
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:33,920
limitations are and they're external

3531
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:36,319
because I'm not without the desire. I'm

3532
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:37,600
not without the energy level of being

3533
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,680
able to do it. I'm not certainly uh

3534
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:41,680
running out of content or the ability to

3535
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:44,880
teach things. I have tons of stuff

3536
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:48,720
and it works perfectly.

3537
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:51,439
So much so I guarantee you people are

3538
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:52,880
scratching their head thinking there is

3539
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:56,479
no way this guy is doing this.

3540
02:21:56,479 --> 02:21:59,600
You're right. But I am

3541
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:01,840
but I am. And I have students all around

3542
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:04,399
the world doing the same thing. I'm not

3543
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:06,640
the only one that last Friday just

3544
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:09,439
happened to work out. I have students

3545
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:12,880
all around the world that did

3546
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:16,399
crazy returns.

3547
02:22:16,399 --> 02:22:19,399
Hello.

3548
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:24,560
What's preventing you in the future

3549
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:27,680
being a part of those ranks? It's just a

3550
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:29,840
decision. Either you decide that you're

3551
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:31,200
going to do it or you're not going to do

3552
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:32,800
it. And I'm going to leave it to you

3553
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:36,920
whether you want to do that or not.
