00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,400
Hello folks, how the heck are you?

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,280
Welcome back. Today is October 4th, 2025

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
and we're doing a quick review on the

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,279
forex market. Usual well suspects are

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,039
and the usual suspects being US dollar,

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,480
fiber or euro USD, cable or pound

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
dollar.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
All

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,880
right, it's going to be easy to go

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
through these because generally the

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
market is just held in a holding pattern

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,520
right now. So you can see how everything

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,480
on dollar is being trapped in between

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,760
this inefficiency and this inefficiency.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
So by grading them you can see the

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,039
pertinent levels here. I have the lowest

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,000
reaching discount wick and I only have

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
this

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,000
suspension block

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
graded

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,200
on the right hand side. You can see the

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,960
five-minute chart reached up into that

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,640
volume imbalance right here. I have the

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
two dark black lines there and I have a

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,200
dashed line indicating its consequent

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,880
encroachment between the two bodies.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
This candlestick's open, this

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,479
candlestick's closed. That's what these

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,560
two levels are here. You can see at the

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
start of

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
trading

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,360
reaches up into

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
that volume imbalance breaks.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
So there's a displacement there. Trades

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,680
right back out to consequent

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
encouragement perfectly.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,360
Then we break lower trading into

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
the bullish fair gap here.

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
And then

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
this quadrant here

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,159
we trade down into it there and it falls

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,520
short of reaching consequent

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,119
encouragement

44
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,280
of the buy balance sell sign efficiency

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,920
shown here at 97

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,640
58 or 582.

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,280
So overall, it's kind of like doing

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
nothing. And I mentioned this earlier in

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
the week, which is another reason why I

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
keep telling you all that keep saying,

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
"Please talk about Forex. Please talk

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
about Forex." Um, if Forex is going to

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
be doing things like this, I'm not

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
interested in it. And it's going to make

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,599
it harder for you as a student to

56
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,040
navigate in that market because it's not

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,680
highly liquid. It's not loose. It's high

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,239
resistance, not low resistance liquidity

59
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,239
runs. So it's very very difficult for

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,480
you to navigate a market like that. So I

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
try to take your attention away from it.

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
I my attention certainly diverted to

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,080
other markets like the futures market.

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,959
But moving on into Euro dollar, similar

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,760
thing we have a sell side balance buy

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,519
sign efficiency highest premium wick

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,640
annotated there. You can see the

68
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,239
consequent encouragement of it here at

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
1.17562

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,480
and the lower quadrant being at 1.17449.

71
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,840
You can see on Friday's trading, we

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,319
traded up into

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,080
the 1.17562

74
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,280
consequent encroachment. I have it

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,599
colored as purple to contrast that

76
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,360
there. Okay? So that way you're not

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,959
going to see that and think that's the

78
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
same level. And then the uh upper

79
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
quadrant coming in at 1.17449.

80
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,959
That's it right here. So really there's

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
nothing in here that's all that exciting

82
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,879
about Euro dollar. It's not moved a lot

83
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,040
at all. I mean it's really really small

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
ranges. So if you get excited around 20

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
handles or 20 pips and to me it's not

86
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,280
worth paying any in mind or any

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
attention to it. Right. Moving on into

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,120
cable. Now this one has a little bit

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,480
better structure. So

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
you can see we had lower quadrant of

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,439
this premium wick being measured and I

92
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,760
also did the lower quadrant on this one

93
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,359
just for uh contrast. Okay. So as we

94
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,160
were compressing smaller in the wicks

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,800
and then the discount wick being shown

96
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
here, you can see that the low is

97
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
defined by the upper quadrant of this

98
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,479
discount wick coming in at 1.34

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
302.

100
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,840
That's that level right there. We have a

101
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,919
shift in market structure. Bu sell side

102
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,720
efficiency comes right back down into it

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,040
and then rallies leaving

104
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,520
that

105
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,240
which is the high of this discount wick

106
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
and then we come right back down into it

107
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,120
there once more trading into this bot

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,840
side of efficiency.

109
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,919
Then it rallies higher. We have a

110
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,759
breaker low high lower low carry that

111
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,919
forward.

112
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,560
That's a breakaway gap

113
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
measuring gap and then trading up into

114
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,240
the quadrant

115
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
1.34864

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
and that's the lower quadrant of this

117
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,440
wick here. Okay,

118
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,360
you would still have this in here by by

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,199
contrast you can see it. So this is one

120
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
objective it could reach for. So words

121
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
if it went to this quadrant and went

122
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
higher you would expect it to reach for

123
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
that one. So that's how we we work

124
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
through nested or closely

125
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
um printed wicks that are in subsequent

126
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,039
candles.

127
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,120
And apart from that really didn't do too

128
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
much at all really. But it had a better

129
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,120
run

130
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,639
about 45 handles or so

131
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,280
maybe 50 handles.

132
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,080
Moving on into futures

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,000
and

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,039
focusing on December mini NASDAQ

135
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,039
futures.

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,639
All right. So on the left hand side I

137
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,639
mentioned this on Twitter yesterday. So

138
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,800
if you look at the uh the posts I didn't

139
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,319
do any live streaming and I mentioned

140
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
what I thought was selling at the time.

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,319
So buy side of balance sell side

142
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,639
efficiency

143
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,240
here and the market was pulling back

144
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
after making another higher high on a

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
Friday.

146
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,639
And I'm showing you Thursday's opening

147
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
range real time or regular trading hours

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
um

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,479
opening range gap rather. That's this

150
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
here. So that'll look familiar. And it

151
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,919
closed that gap there perfectly. Then

152
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,120
came right back up to it again there.

153
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,160
Came back down to consequent

154
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
encroachment.

155
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Rallied up into some random level in

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,039
here and then fell out of bed and then

157
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,720
took out the intermediate term sellside

158
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
liquidity pool I mentioned on Thursday's

159
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,960
commentary.

160
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,479
And looking at that rally, it takes us

161
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,240
right back up into Thursday's regular

162
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
trading hours opening range gap lower

163
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
quadrant. So the labels here are

164
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
Thursday's regular trading hours closing

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
price

166
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,919
Thursday's regular trading hours opening

167
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,280
range gap lower quadrant consequent

168
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,400
encroachment upper quadrant

169
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,160
the opening price there based on

170
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
Thursday's trading no opening range gap

171
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,599
is being plotted in this discussion on

172
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,840
Friday's trading when you have these

173
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,479
real big wide gaps like that you

174
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,319
definitely want to carry them forward

175
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,599
and they're going to be utilized the

176
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,800
next day. Especially if you're inside

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
the range, what between what boundaries

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,479
am I referring to inside what range? The

179
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,360
high and the low of that previous day's

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
opening range gap.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
So, just notice how the sensitivity here

182
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,680
like that's that's beautiful. It's not

183
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
pivot numbers. It's not support and

184
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
resistance.

185
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
So, dropping down into a one minute

186
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,800
chart because we were just looking at a

187
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
five-minute chart. Now we're only

188
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
looking at Friday's trading. So here's

189
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,160
first presented fair gap there and

190
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,520
carrying that forward and grading it.

191
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
You can see all those levels. We trade

192
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,360
up into Thursday's regular trading hours

193
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,160
opening range gap high

194
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,719
and we break down. And now refer to

195
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,719
yesterday or October 3rd, 2025's

196
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,800
commentary and the notes I posted in

197
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,080
Telegram and you'll see what these

198
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,480
suspension blocks are.

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm not going to go over it again here,

200
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,200
but we trade down to consequent

201
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
encouragement

202
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,839
of this discount wick.

203
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,160
Carry that forward. We trade up into

204
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
first present fair gap

205
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
hits all the quadrant levels. Consequent

206
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,519
encroachment, we break lower. We have a

207
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,040
bullish fair gap. That becomes an

208
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,560
inversion fair gap here. And again at

209
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,519
the regular trading hours, opening range

210
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,080
gap upper quadrant. Okay, I saw some

211
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,399
people that were saying I was calling

212
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,000
this level wrong. It's not the upper

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,279
quadrant. You don't know what you're

214
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,640
talking about. Okay, that's why I

215
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,360
broomed you off of um X. I I won't look

216
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,519
at your your post. Don't try to correct

217
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,320
me about something I know.

218
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
You're just learning about it here and

219
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,959
talk to me about what you think I'm

220
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,360
doing wrong. I'll make mistakes, but I I

221
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,640
know what I was talking about when I was

222
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,640
posting it. So it sells off here

223
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,839
and trades down into the lower quadrant

224
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,240
and then all the way back up to the

225
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
higher suspension block. Now this

226
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
is shaded not green here like it was

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
when I presented to you yesterday. It

228
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
now it's acting as an inversion level.

229
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,399
So it's going to be a premium array.

230
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,000
Hits the consequent encroachment of that

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,720
perfectly and sells off. Comes back up

232
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,760
inside this one again sells off.

233
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,720
inefficiency inversion fair value gap

234
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,480
after this fails and when it's heavy and

235
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
bearish that's what we want to see and I

236
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,200
mentioned that we would see the lower

237
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
quadrant and then the fair value I asked

238
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
on Twitter did you have this highlighted

239
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
on your daily chart and is it graded and

240
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,760
we got down to lower quadrant I'm sorry

241
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,200
upper quadrant rather at 24,955

242
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,920
that's this level here. It trades down

243
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,560
to here and gets very very close to

244
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,399
consequent encroachment but says not

245
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,360
today and came off that and closed up

246
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,360
here.

247
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
EGIF conditions

248
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,000
we had a high of the week at 25,196 and

249
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
a half and the low came in at 24,633

250
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,959
and a quarter. That's this candlestick's

251
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,279
wick and this candlestick's wick making

252
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,399
the daily range. uh boundaries high and

253
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,240
low. And then here is the 20% of the

254
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,600
range. It's 25,83

255
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,519
and 3/4.

256
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
30% of the range of the week is 25,27.

257
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,600
And then 40% was 24,971.25.

258
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,360
And those levels here, you can see them

259
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
right here. They're shortened and they

260
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
don't go all the way to the um hard

261
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
right edge. And you can see how they

262
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,279
were delivered too. So TGIF was uh

263
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
delivered actually almost went down to

264
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,240
half the weekly range left that portion

265
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,959
with that candlesticks wick that opened

266
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,200
as well.

267
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,120
All right. So moving into the afternoon

268
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
all I did was move forward in the chart

269
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
and you can see how we came up into

270
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,000
consequent corrosion with that

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,279
suspension block that becomes an

272
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,720
inversion level. Same here. fills in

273
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,160
that small little gap right there. It's

274
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,560
too small for me to annotate. Breaks

275
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
lower. The bodies are respecting the

276
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
upper quadrant. Doesn't come up to the

277
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,839
top of this buy side balance outside

278
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,079
efficiency.

279
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,240
Measure your volume imbalance and then

280
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,839
breaks lower, hits the low of it, and

281
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,839
then sells off and comes right back up

282
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,920
to that same inversion fair gap and then

283
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,160
just hammers and bangs in between 40% of

284
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,560
the weekly range and 30% of the weekly

285
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,880
range. And the river trading hours

286
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
closing price from Thursday. And that's

287
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
where it defined the range going into

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,279
the close.

289
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,959
Now, for the folks that complain and

290
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,800
belly ache to me, please talk about

291
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,519
Forex because you trade CFDs or Forex

292
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
pairs outside the US.

293
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,560
I don't know why you're not doing this,

294
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
okay? Because you're

295
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,920
able to follow what I'm doing in NASDAQ

296
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,600
with US 100. Okay? So, if you go on to

297
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
Trading View, and this is being used,

298
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
and I'm not suggesting that you should

299
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,079
open up an account or trade with this

300
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,399
brokerage firm, but Capital.com.

301
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,720
Pull that up for the US 100 market.

302
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
Okay, this is the CFD version of NASDAQ

303
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
futures contract. It's not going to mark

304
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,279
to market perfectly, but I'm going to

305
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,920
show you here that it's doing the same

306
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,600
things I'm teaching that the futures

307
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
market is doing. So instead of

308
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
complaining to me and leaving comments

309
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
in in the sections of my video where I

310
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
broom you, I make you invisible to the

311
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
channel. That means I'm never going to

312
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,680
see your comment anymore.

313
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
Listen to me here, okay? Because your

314
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
time with me learning will be greatly

315
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,320
increased and be much more fruitful if

316
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,959
you listen to what I'm going to say.

317
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,720
Daily chart of the US 100. Okay, same

318
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,839
thing happening here. This is TGIF.

319
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,760
Same thing high and low half 40% 20%. it

320
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,839
had that much of a retracement. But more

321
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
specifically first presented fair value

322
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
gap it trades up into it there hits the

323
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,000
quadrants consequent encouragement sells

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,360
off the upper quadrant of Thursday's

325
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,800
regular trading hours opening range gap

326
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
regular trading hours opening range gap

327
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,480
high

328
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
let's go encroachment

329
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
lower quadrant and the low of the

330
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
regular trading hours opening range gap

331
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,320
low and how am I getting those levels on

332
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,440
US 100.

333
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,040
Think about it. Pause the video and

334
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,199
think about how I got those levels

335
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,760
because there is no

336
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,040
regular trading hours for a CFD.

337
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
I already taught this before, but you

338
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,279
just didn't listen. You don't listen.

339
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,360
You don't you don't take notes. You're

340
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,639
so worried about what I'm going to teach

341
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,279
new. But the things I'm jawbing about,

342
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,480
that's the stuff where you're really

343
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,800
learning. What you're doing is you're

344
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,199
going to be going into

345
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,440
4:14 p.m. Eastern time where that price

346
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,240
is, annotate that with a line segment

347
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
like this one here, the ray, and then

348
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,279
label that river trading hours closing

349
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,680
price for whatever day it is. Okay? And

350
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,199
when you're creating it, you're creating

351
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,639
it for the next trading day. So, if

352
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,440
you're looking at it on 4:14 p.m.

353
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,760
Eastern time on a Wednesday, you're

354
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,399
looking at a Thursday opening range

355
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,000
level. That's how you're going to define

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
it. And then you're going to wait until

357
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,360
9:30 Eastern time the next morning. And

358
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,519
when it opens up, that's your other

359
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,120
reference point. So, between those two

360
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,720
reference points, that's going to be

361
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,160
your regular trading hours, opening

362
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,959
range gap, high and low.

363
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,560
There won't be a gap. You're just simply

364
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,279
just going to the one minute candlestick

365
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,480
for 9:30 a.m. Eastern time and 4:14 p.m.

366
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
Eastern time. And you're going to get

367
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
the same information that I'm showing

368
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
you here.

369
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,560
And it's the same thing that I'm

370
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
teaching with the futures market. Why

371
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,160
are you complicating everything?

372
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,600
And you can see how we delivered down

373
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,839
into

374
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,079
the upper quadrant just like I did in

375
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,680
the futures market. Calling it on uh X

376
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,079
on Friday afternoon. We traded down into

377
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,440
the upper quadrant of the buy side

378
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,720
balance sellside sign efficiency and

379
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
then it came right back off that and

380
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,440
trading right near the regular trading

381
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
hours opening range gap low from

382
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,560
Thursday's trading. Don't just discard

383
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,759
the previous days opening range gaps.

384
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,759
You're going to see that then algorithm

385
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,920
is still using them. And because this is

386
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,959
going to track the real futures market,

387
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
where is it going to get its, you know,

388
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,680
rhyme and reason for where it's going to

389
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
go up and down? what that futures

390
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,079
market's doing.

391
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,279
All right, folks. That's it for this

392
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,360
one. Hope you found it insightful. Until

393
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,040
talk to you next time, I wish you good

394
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,720
luck and good trading.
